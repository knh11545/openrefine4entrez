TI  - Activated Peripheral Blood B Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Their Relationship to 
      Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Treatment and Response: A Randomized Clinical Trial of 
      the Effects of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor on B Cells.
PG  - 200-211
LID - 10.1002/art.41941 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: B cells can become activated in germinal center (GC) reactions in 
      secondary lymphoid tissue and in ectopic GCs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium 
      that may be tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin (LT) dependent. This study 
      was undertaken to characterize the peripheral B cell compartment longitudinally 
      during anti-TNF therapy in RA. METHODS: Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio 
      to receive standard dosing regimens of etanercept (n = 43) or adalimumab (n = 20) 
      for 24 weeks. Eligible participants met the American College of Rheumatology 1987 
      criteria for RA, had clinically active disease (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints 
      >4.4), and were receiving stable doses of methotrexate. The primary mechanistic end 
      point was the change in switched memory B cell fraction from baseline to week 12 in 
      each treatment group. RESULTS: B cell subsets remained surprisingly stable over the 
      course of the study regardless of treatment group, with no significant change in 
      memory B cells. Blockade of TNF and LT with etanercept compared to blockade of TNF 
      alone with adalimumab did not translate into significant differences in clinical 
      response. The frequencies of multiple activated B cell populations, including CD21- 
      double-negative memory and activated naive B cells, were higher in RA nonresponders 
      at all time points, and CD95+ activated B cell frequencies were increased in 
      patients receiving anti-TNF treatment in the nonresponder group. In contrast, 
      frequencies of transitional B cells-a putative regulatory subset-were lower in the 
      nonresponders. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results support the notion that peripheral 
      blood B cell subsets are remarkably stable in RA and not differentially impacted by 
      dual blockade of TNF and LT with etanercept or single blockade of TNF with 
      adalimumab. Activated B cells do associate with a less robust response.

TI  - Concomitant loss of regulatory T and B cells is a distinguishing immune feature of 
      antibody-mediated rejection in kidney transplantation.

LID - 10.1016/j.kint.2021.12.027 [doi]
AB  - Although considerable advances have been made in understanding the cellular effector 
      mechanisms responsible for donor-specific antibody generation leading to 
      antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), the identification of cellular regulators of 
      such immune responses is lacking. To clarify this, we used high dimensional flow 
      cytometry to concomitantly profile and track the two major subsets of regulatory 
      lymphocytes in blood: T regulatory (T(REG)) and transitional B cells in a cohort of 
      96 kidney transplant recipients. Additionally, we established co-culture assays to 
      address their respective capacity to suppress antibody responses in vitro. TREG and 
      transitional B cells were found to be potent suppressors of T follicular 
      helper-mediated B cell differentiation into plasmablast and antibody generation. 
      TREG and transitional B cells were both durably expanded in patients who did not 
      develop donor-specific antibody post-transplant. However, patients who manifested 
      donor-specific antibody and progressed to ABMR displayed a marked and persistent 
      numerical reduction in TREG and transitional B cells. Strikingly, specific cell 
      clusters expressing the transcription factor T-bet were selectively depleted in both 
      TREG and transitional B cell compartments in patients with ABMR. Importantly, the 
      coordinated loss of these T-bet(+)CXCR5(+)TREG and T-bet(+)CD21(-) transitional B 
      cell clusters was correlated with increased and inflammatory donor specific antibody 
      responses, more extensive microvascular inflammation and a higher rate of kidney 
      allograft loss. Thus, our study identified coordinated and persistent defects in 
      regulatory T and B cell responses in patients undergoing ABMR, which may contribute 
      to their loss of humoral immune regulation, and warrant timely therapeutic 
      interventions to replenish and sustain TREG and transitional B cells in these 
      patients.

AB  - Type I IFN is essential for viral clearance but also contributes to the pathogenesis 
      of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), via aberrant 
      nucleic acid-sensing pathways, leading to autoantibody production. Type III IFN 
      (IFN-λ) is now appreciated to have a nonredundant role in viral infection, but few 
      studies have addressed the effects of IFN-λ on immune cells given the more 
      restricted expression of its receptor primarily to the epithelium. In this study, we 
      demonstrate that B cells display a prominent IFN gene expression profile in patients 
      with lupus. Serum levels of IFN-λ are elevated in SLE and positively correlate with 
      B cell subsets associated with autoimmune plasma cell development, including 
      CD11c(+)T-bet(+)CD21(-) B cells. Although B cell subsets express all IFN receptors, 
      IFNLR1 strongly correlates with the CD11c(+)CD21(-) B cell expansion, suggesting 
      that IFN-λ may be an unappreciated driver of the SLE IFN signature and B cell 
      abnormalities. We show that IFN-λ potentiates gene transcription in human B cells 
      typically attributed to type I IFN as well as expansion of T-bet-expressing B cells 
      after BCR and TLR7/8 stimulation. Further, IFN-λ promotes TLR7/8-mediated 
      plasmablast differentiation and increased IgM production. CD11c(+) B cells 
      demonstrate IFN-λ hyperresponsive signaling compared with other B cell subsets, 
      suggesting that IFN-λ accelerates plasma cell differentiation through this putative 
      extrafollicular pathway. In summary, our data support type III IFN-λ as a cytokine 
      promoting the Ab-secreting cell pool in human viral and autoimmune disease.

AB  - Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays pivotal roles in innate 
      and adaptive immunity. It is also a promising cytokine for treating cancer. Despite 
      growing interest in its use as an immunotherapeutic, its safety and immunological 
      effects in dogs have not been reported. In this study, healthy dogs were given 
      recombinant canine IL-15 (rcIL-15) intravenously at a daily dose of 20 μg/kg for 
      8 days and monitored for 32 days to determine the safety and immunological effects 
      of rcIL-15. The repeated administration of rcIL-15 was well tolerated, did not cause 
      any serious side effects, and promoted the selective proliferation and activation of 
      canine anti-cancer effector cells, including CD3(+)CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes, 
      CD3(+)CD5(dim)CD21(-), and non-B/non-T NK cell populations, without stimulating 
      T(reg) lymphocytes. The rcIL-15 injections also stimulated the expression of 
      molecules and transcription factors associated with the activation and effector 
      functions of NK cells, including CD16, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, perforin, 
      granzyme B, Ly49, T-bet, and Eomes. These results suggest that rcIL-15 might be a 
      valuable therapeutic adjuvant to improve immunity against cancer in dogs.

      stage, cells with a functional heavy chain expand in response to signals from IL-7 
      and the pre-BCR. Cells then cease proliferation at the small pre-B stage and 
      rearrange the immunoglobulin light chain gene. The fully formed BCR is subsequently 
      expressed on the surface of immature B cells and autoreactive cells are culled by 
      central tolerance mechanisms. Once in the periphery, transitional B cells develop 
      into mature B cell subsets such as marginal zone and follicular B cells. These 
      developmental processes are controlled by transcription factor networks, central to 
      which are IRF4 and IRF8. These were thought to act redundantly during B cell 
      development in the bone marrow, with their functions diverging in the periphery 
      where IRF4 limits the number of marginal zone B cells and is required for germinal 
      center responses and plasma cell differentiation. Because of IRF4's unique role in 
      mature B cells, we hypothesized that it may also have functions earlier in B cell 
      development that cannot be compensated for by IRF8. Indeed, we find that IRF4 has a 
      unique role in upregulating the pre-B cell marker CD25, limiting IL-7 
      responsiveness, and promoting migration to CXCR4 such that IRF4-deficient mice have 
      a partial block at the pre-B cell stage. We also find that IRF4 acts in early 
      transitional B cells to restrict marginal zone B cell development, as deletion of 
      IRF4 in mature B cells with CD21-cre impairs plasma cell differentiation but has no 
      effect on marginal zone B cell numbers. These studies highlight IRF4 as the dominant 
      IRF family member in early B lymphopoiesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of kidney transplantation performed in elderly patients 
      has increased steadily recently. Higher risk of infection and mortality, but lower 
      rate of rejection, are reported in older kidney transplant patients. This study aims 
      to analyze the effect of transplantation on aging of T and B cells in kidney 
      transplant patients, with the emphasis on age and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) latency. 
      RESULTS: We included 36 patients before and after (median 2.7 years) kidney 
      transplantation and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). T and B cell 
      subsets were measured by flow cytometry, with a focus on aged T cells (CD28-), and 
      age associated B cells (ABCs, CD19 + CD21-CD11c+). Three years after transplantation 
      a significant increase of total T cells among the lymphocytes was found compared to 
      pre-transplantation and HC. Among the T cells CD4+ cells were decreased, especially 
      naïve CD4+ cells and regulatory T cells. Total CD8+ cell proportions were increased, 
      and proportions of naïve CD8+ cells were significantly decreased after 
      transplantation, while CD8+ effector memory T cells re-expressing CD45RA were 
      increased. CD28- T cells were significantly higher compared to HC after 
      transplantation, especially in CMV seropositive patients. B cells were significantly 
      decreased, while among B cells memory B cells and especially ABCs were increased 
      after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: After transplantation T and B cell subsets 
      change towards more terminally differentiated memory cells compared to age-matched 
      HC. Proportions of aged T cells and ABCs were associated with CMV serostatus.

TI  - Upregulated IL-10 induced by E2F2-miR-17-5p circuitry in extrafollicular effector B 
      cells contributes to autoantibody production in systemic lupus erythematosus.
LID - 10.1002/art.41987 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Elevated interleukin 10 (IL10) in SLE patients has B-cell promoting 
      effects, contributing to autoantibody production and tissue damage. We aimed to 
      characterize upregulated IL10(+) B-cell subsets and dysregulated IL10 expression in 
      SLE B cells for new therapeutic options. METHODS: Proportions of Th10 and IL10(+) 
      B-cell subsets in PBMCs were assessed using flow cytometry. The IL10-3'UTR 
      dual-luciferase vector was constructed and co-transfected with siRNA, miRNA mimics 
      or inhibitors into RAJI cell line. Transcript levels were quantified using Taqman 
      assays. RESULTS: Culture conditions that induced IL10(+) Breg in healthy controls 
      (HC) resulted in expansion of IL10(+) DN2 (IgD(-) CD27(-) CD21(-) CD11c(+) ) B-cells 
      in SLE PBMCs. Proportions of IL10(+) DN2, but not those of IL10(-) DN2, correlated 
      with disease activity, levels of antibodies to dsDNA, and associated with high 
      levels or seropositivity of anti-Smith and anti-cardiolipin IgG in SLE patients from 
      two cohorts of mainly African Americans and Asians, respectively. Proportions of 
      Th10 (CD45RA(-) CXCR5(-) CXCR3(+) PD1(hi) CD4(+) ) cells correlated with IL10(+) DN2 
      frequencies, ANA titers and proteinuria levels in SLE patients. Screening predicted 
      IL10 3'UTR-targeting miRNAs in SLE B cells identified miR-17-5p and miR-20a-5p with 
      their levels inversely correlated with IL10 and transcription factor E2F2. In RAJI 
      cells, knockdown of E2F2 expression resulted in increased levels of miR-17-5p and 
      miR-20a-5p and decreased IL10 mRNA and protein levels, and overexpression and 
      inhibition of miR-17-5p down-regulated and up-regulated IL10 mRNA levels 
      respectively; suggesting regulation of IL10 expression by E2F2-miR-17-5p loop. 
      CONCLUSION: IL10 promotes extrafollicular autoimmune responses in active SLE 
      patients, which might be dampened by targeting the E2F2-miR-17-5p circuitry.

LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.6572-20 [doi]
AB  - A 30-year-old woman was diagnosed with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) that 
      harbored a clonal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome. At relapse, axillary lymph node 
      adenopathy, which was diagnosed as peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise 
      specified (PTCL-NOS), was detected. Southern blot analyses of the T-cell receptor 
      and EBV genome revealed that the T-LBL and PTCL-NOS were clonally identical. We 
      previously showed that CD21 acted as an entry molecule that allowed EBV into the 
      patient's T-LBL cells. Interestingly, the PTCL-NOS cells lacked CD21 expression. Our 
      case suggests that EBV might infect immature CD21-positive T-cells, and 
      CD21-negative PTCL-NOS might subsequently arise through phenotypic changes.

TI  - Phthalide derivative CD21 attenuates tissue plasminogen activator-induced 
      hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke by enhancing macrophage scavenger 
      receptor 1-mediated DAMP (peroxiredoxin 1) clearance.
PG  - 143

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a critical issue in thrombolytic 
      therapy in acute ischemic stroke. Damage-associated molecular pattern 
      (DAMP)-stimulated sterile neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the development 
      of thrombolysis-associated HT. Our previous study showed that the phthalide 
      derivative CD21 attenuated neuroinflammation and brain injury in rodent models of 
      ischemic stroke. The present study explored the effects and underlying mechanism of 
      action of CD21 on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced HT in a mouse model of 
      transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and cultured primary microglial 
      cells. METHODS: The tMCAO model was induced by 2 h occlusion of the left middle 
      cerebral artery with polylysine-coated sutures in wildtype (WT) mice and macrophage 
      scavenger receptor 1 knockout (MSR1(-/-)) mice. At the onset of reperfusion, tPA (10 
      mg/kg) was intravenously administered within 30 min, followed by an intravenous 
      injection of CD21 (13.79 mg/kg/day). Neuropathological changes were detected in mice 
      3 days after surgery. The effect of CD21 on phagocytosis of the DAMP peroxiredoxin 1 
      (Prx1) in lysosomes was observed in cultured primary microglial cells from brain 
      tissues of WT and MSR1(-/-) mice. RESULTS: Seventy-two hours after brain ischemia, 
      CD21 significantly attenuated neurobehavioral dysfunction and infarct volume. The 
      tPA-infused group exhibited more severe brain dysfunction and hemorrhage. Compared 
      with tPA alone, combined treatment with tPA and CD21 significantly attenuated 
      ischemic brain injury and hemorrhage. Combined treatment significantly decreased 
      Evans blue extravasation, matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression and activity, 
      extracellular Prx1 content, proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels, glial cells, and 
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway activation and 
      increased the expression of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1 and 
      claudin-5), V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B, and MSR1. MSR1 
      knockout significantly abolished the protective effect of CD21 against tPA-induced 
      HT in tMCAO mice. Moreover, the CD21-induced phagocytosis of Prx1 was MSR1-dependent 
      in cultured primary microglial cells from WT and MSR1(-/-) mice, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: The phthalide derivative CD21 attenuated tPA-induced HT in acute 
      ischemic stroke by promoting MSR1-induced DAMP (Prx1) clearance and inhibition of 
      the TLR4/NF-κB pathway and neuroinflammation.

AB  - Alloimmune responses driven by donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) can lead to 
      antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) in organ transplantation. Yet, the cellular 
      states underlying alloreactive B cell responses and the molecular components 
      controlling them remain unclear. Using high-dimensional profiling of B cells in a 
      cohort of 96 kidney transplant recipients, we identified expanded numbers of 
      CD27+CD21- activated memory (AM) B cells that expressed the transcription factor 
      T-bet in patients who developed DSAs and progressed to ABMR. Notably, AM cells were 
      less frequent in DSA+ABMR- patients and at baseline levels in DSA- patients. RNA-Seq 
      analysis of AM cells in patients undergoing ABMR revealed these cells to be poised 
      for plasma cell differentiation and to express restricted IGHV sequences reflective 
      of clonal expansion. In addition to T-bet, AM cells manifested elevated expression 
      of interferon regulatory factor 4 and Blimp1, and upon coculture with autologous T 
      follicular helper cells, differentiated into DSA-producing plasma cells in an 
      IL-21-dependent manner. The frequency of AM cells was correlated with the timing and 
      severity of ABMR manifestations. Importantly, T-bet+ AM cells were detected within 
      kidney allografts along with their restricted IGHV sequences. This study delineates 
      a pivotal role for AM cells in promoting humoral responses and ABMR in organ 
      transplantation and highlights them as important therapeutic targets.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize lymphocytes dysregulation in patients with 
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). METHODS: 
      Using flow cytometry, we analysed B- and T-cell subsets in peripheral blood from 37 
      untreated patients with active disease (29 GPA and 8 MPA) and 22 healthy controls 
      (HCs). RESULTS: GPA patients had increased Th2 (1.8 vs 1.0%, P = 0.02), Th9 (1.1 vs 
      0.2%, P = 0.0007) and Th17 (1.4 vs 0.9%, P = 0.03) cells compared with HC. Patients 
      with MPO-ANCAs had significantly more CD21- B cells than HC or PR3-ANCA patients 
      (6.9 vs 3.3% and 4.4%, P = 0.01). CD69 expressing B cells were significantly higher 
      in GPA and MPA (3.0 and 5.9 vs 1.4%, P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively) compared 
      with HC, whereas B-cell activating factor-receptor expression was decreased in GPA 
      and MPA (median fluorescence intensity ratio 11.8 and 13.7 vs 45.1 in HC, P < 0.0001 
      and P = 0.003, respectively). Finally, IL-6-producing B cells were increased in GPA 
      vs HC (25.8 vs 14.9%, P < 0.0001) and decreased in MPA vs HC (4.6 vs 14.9%, 
      P = 0.005), whereas TNF-α-producing B cells were lower in both GPA and MPA patients 
      compared with controls (15 and 8.4 vs 30%, P = 0.01 and P = 0.006, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: Skewed T-cell polarization towards Th2, Th9 and Th17 responses 
      characterizes GPA, whereas B-cell populations are dysregulated in both GPA and MPA 
      with an activated phenotype and a decreased B-cell activating factor-receptor 
      expression. Finally, inflammatory B cells producing IL-6 are dramatically increased 
      in GPA, providing an additional mechanism by which rituximab could be effective.

AB  - HIV-infected infants are at an increased risk of progressing rapidly to AIDS in the 
      first weeks of life. Here, we evaluated immunological and virological parameters in 
      25 SIV-infected infant rhesus macaques to understand the factors influencing a rapid 
      disease outcome. Infant macaques were infected with SIVmac251 and monitored for 10 
      to 17 weeks post-infection. SIV-infected infants were divided into either typical 
      (TypP) or rapid (RP) progressor groups based on levels of plasma anti-SIV antibody 
      and viral load, with RP infants having low SIV-specific antibodies and high viral 
      loads. Following SIV infection, 11 out of 25 infant macaques exhibited an RP 
      phenotype. Interestingly, TypP had lower levels of total CD4 T cells, similar 
      reductions in CD4/CD8 ratios and elevated activation of CD8 T cells, as measured by 
      the levels of HLA-DR, compared to RP. Differences between the two groups were 
      identified in other immune cell populations, including a failure to expand activated 
      memory (CD21-CD27+) B cells in peripheral blood in RP infant macaques, as well as 
      reduced levels of germinal center (GC) B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells 
      in spleens (4- and 10-weeks post-SIV). Reduced B cell proliferation in splenic 
      germinal GCs was associated with increased SIV+ cell density and follicular type 1 
      interferon (IFN)-induced immune activation. Further analyses determined that at 
      2-weeks post SIV infection TypP infants exhibited elevated levels of the GC-inducing 
      chemokine CXCL13 in plasma, as well as significantly lower levels of viral envelope 
      diversity compared to RP infants. Our findings provide evidence that early viral and 
      immunologic events following SIV infection contributes to impairment of B cells, Tfh 
      cells and germinal center formation, ultimately impeding the development of 
      SIV-specific antibody responses in rapidly progressing infant macaques.

TI  - Atypical phenotype and response of B cells in patients with seropositive rheumatoid 
      arthritis.
PG  - 221-238
LID - 10.1111/cei.13576 [doi]
AB  - Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be classified as seropositive or 
      seronegative according to the presence of autoantibodies. An abnormal B cell 
      phenotype and function could be one of the main components of the immunopathology of 
      seropositive patients; however, there is little information regarding B cell defects 
      in these patients. This study shows a broad characterization of the B cell phenotype 
      and function in patients with seropositive RA. We focused mainly on the evaluation 
      of subsets, the expression of modulatory molecules of cell activation (CD22, FcɣRIIb 
      and FcµR), calcium mobilization, global tyrosine phosphorylation, expression of 
      activation markers, cytokine and immunoglobulin (Ig) production, proliferation and 
      the in-vitro generation of plasma cells. Increased frequency of CD27(-) IgM(-) 
      IgD(-) and CD21(-) B cells was observed in patients with seropositive RA compared 
      with healthy donors (HD). Decreased expression of CD22 was primarily found in memory 
      B cells of patients with RA regardless of seropositivity. B cells from seropositive 
      patients exhibited normal proliferation, calcium mobilization kinetics and global 
      tyrosine phosphorylation, but showed an increased frequency of CD86(+) B cells 
      compared with HD. B cells of seropositive patients secrete less interleukin-10 after 
      in-vitro activation and showed a decreased frequency of plasma cell differentiation 
      and IgM production compared with HD. Our data indicate that patients with 
      seropositive RA have an increased frequency of atypical B cell populations 
      previously associated with chronic activation and antigen exposure. This may result 
      in the observed low responsiveness of these cells in vitro.

TI  - Pattern of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Mixed Epithelial and Stromal Tumor of 
      the Kidney: A Review of Five Cases.
LID - 10.3390/cells10040917 [doi]
LID - 917
AB  - Mixed epithelial and stromal tumor of the kidney (MESTK), a benign rare tumor with 
      malignant transformation potential, is thought to be derived from fetal or immature 
      cells originating from the mesonephric and Müllerian ducts. However, due to its 
      rarity, little is known about the anti-tumor immune responses in MESTK. Herein, we 
      present five cases of MESTK and evaluate the population of tumor-infiltrating 
      lymphocytes (TILs) using a freshly obtained MESTK sample. Microscopically, TILs were 
      scattered or clustered in large aggregates in the stroma in all five cases; 
      furthermore, three cases exhibited heavy, large lymphocytic aggregates with no 
      well-organized tertiary lymphoid structures with germinal centers. Flow cytometric 
      analysis of TILs in one freshly obtained MESTK sample revealed that >40% of CD3(+) T 
      cells were effector memory Fas(+)CD28(-) γδ T cells expressing high levels of 
      programmed cell death protein 1 and inducible T-cell co-stimulator, but low levels 
      of CD44 and CD27. Most αß T cells exhibited a naïve phenotype. Additionally, we 
      detected many activated class-switched CD21(+)CD27(+) B cells as well as 
      CD11c(high)IgM(high) marginal zone B-like and CD27(-)CD21(-)CD23(-) immunoglobulin 
      (Ig)D(high)IgM(low) age-associated B-like cells. Collectively, for the first time, 
      we report the immune microenvironment pattern of MESTK to oncogenic stress.

LID - 635615
AB  - Circulating CD11c(+) B cells are a key phenomenon in certain types of autoimmunity 
      but have also been described in the context of regular immune responses (i.e., 
      infections, vaccination). Using mass cytometry to profile 46 different markers on 
      individual immune cells, we systematically initially confirmed the presence of 
      increased CD11c(+) B cells in the blood of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
      patients. Notably, significant differences in the expression of CD21, CD27, and CD38 
      became apparent between CD11c(-) and CD11c(+) B cells. We observed direct 
      correlation of the frequency of CD21(-)CD27(-) B cells and CD21(-)CD38(-) B cells 
      with CD11c(+) B cells, which were most pronounced in SLE compared to primary 
      Sjögren's syndrome patients (pSS) and healthy donors (HD). Thus, CD11c(+) B cells 
      resided mainly within memory subsets and were enriched in CD27(-)IgD(-), 
      CD21(-)CD27(-), and CD21(-)CD38(-) B cell phenotypes. CD11c(+) B cells from all 
      donor groups (SLE, pSS, and HD) showed enhanced CD69, Ki-67, CD45RO, CD45RA, and 
      CD19 expression, whereas the membrane expression of CXCR5 and CD21 were diminished. 
      Notably, SLE CD11c(+) B cells showed enhanced expression of the checkpoint molecules 
      CD86, PD1, PDL1, CD137, VISTA, and CTLA-4 compared to HD. The substantial increase 
      of CD11c(+) B cells with a CD21(-) phenotype co-expressing distinct activation and 
      checkpoint markers, points to a quantitative increased alternate (extrafollicular) B 
      cell activation route possibly related to abnormal immune regulation as seen under 
      the striking inflammatory conditions of SLE which shows a characteristic PD-1/PD-L1 
      upregulation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by defective 
      antibody production and hypogammaglobulinemia. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping of 
      blood lymphocytes has become of great relevance for the diagnosis and classification 
      of CVID, due to an impaired differentiation of mature post-germinal-center (GC) 
      class-switched memory B-cells (MBC) and severely decreased plasmablast/plasma cell 
      (Pb) counts. Here, we investigated in detail the pre-GC B-cell maturation 
      compartment in blood of CVID patients. METHODS: In this collaborative multicentric 
      study the EuroFlow PID 8-color Pre-GC B-cell tube, standardized sample preparation 
      procedures (SOPs) and innovative data analysis tools, were used to characterize the 
      maturation profile of pre-GC B-cells in 100 CVID patients, vs 62 age-matched healthy 
      donors (HD). RESULTS: The Pre-GC B-cell tube allowed identification within pre-GC 
      B-cells of three subsets of maturation associated immature B-cells and three 
      subpopulations of mature naïve B-lymphocytes. CVID patients showed overall reduced 
      median absolute counts (vs HD) of the two more advanced stages of maturation of both 
      CD5(+) CD38(+/++) CD21(het) CD24(++) (2.7 vs 5.6 cells/µl, p=0.0004) and CD5(+) 
      CD38(het) CD21(+) CD24(+) (6.5 vs 17 cells/µl, p<0.0001) immature B cells (below 
      normal HD levels in 22% and 37% of CVID patients). This was associated with an 
      expansion of CD21(-)CD24(-) (6.1 vs 0.74 cells/µl, p<0.0001) and CD21(-)CD24(++) 
      (1.8 vs 0.4 cells/µl, p<0.0001) naïve B-cell counts above normal values in 73% and 
      94% cases, respectively. Additionally, reduced IgMD(+) (21 vs 32 cells/µl, p=0.03) 
      and IgMD(-) (4 vs 35 cells/µl, p<0.0001) MBC counts were found to be below normal 
      values in 25% and 77% of CVID patients, respectively, always together with severely 
      reduced/undetectable circulating blood pb. Comparison of the maturation pathway 
      profile of pre-GC B cells in blood of CVID patients vs HD using EuroFlow software 
      tools showed systematically altered patterns in CVID. These consisted of: i) a 
      normally-appearing maturation pathway with altered levels of expression of >1 (CD38, 
      CD5, CD19, CD21, CD24, and/or smIgM) phenotypic marker (57/88 patients; 65%) for a 
      total of 3 distinct CVID patient profiles (group 1: 42/88 patients, 48%; group 2: 
      8/88, 9%; and group 3: 7/88, 8%) and ii) CVID patients with a clearly altered pre-GC 
      B cell maturation pathway in blood (group 4: 31/88 cases, 35%). CONCLUSION: Our 
      results show that maturation of pre-GC B-cells in blood of CVID is systematically 
      altered with up to four distinctly altered maturation profiles. Further studies, are 
      necessary to better understand the impact of such alterations on the post-GC defects 
      and the clinical heterogeneity of CVID.

TI  - B cell analysis in SARS-CoV-2 versus malaria: Increased frequencies of plasmablasts 
      and atypical memory B cells in COVID-19.
PG  - 77-90

AB  - B cells play a central role in antiviral and antiparasitic immunity, not only as 
      producers of antibodies, but also as APCs and mediators of inflammation. In this 
      study, we used 16-color flow cytometry analysis to investigate the frequency, 
      differentiation, and activation status of peripheral B cells of patients with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection or acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria compared with the 
      healthy individuals. As a main result, we observed an increase of the frequency of 
      (CD27(-), CD21(-)) atypical memory B cells and (CD19(+), CD27(+), CD38(+)) 
      plasmablasts in malaria and COVID-19 patients. Additionally, CD86, PD-1, CXCR3, and 
      CD39 expression was up-regulated, whereas CD73 was down-regulated on plasmablasts of 
      COVID-19 and malaria patients compared with the bulk B cell population. In 
      particular, there was a more pronounced loss of CD73(+) B cells in malaria. The 
      frequency of plasmablasts positively correlated with serum levels of CRP, IL-6, and 
      LDH of COVID-19 patients. In the longitudinal course of COVID-19, a rapid 
      normalization of the frequency of atypical memory B cells was observed. The role and 
      function of plasmablasts and atypical memory B cells in COVID-19 and other acute 
      infections remain to be further investigated. The role of B cells as either "driver 
      or passenger" of hyperinflammation during COVID-19 needs to be clarified.

TI  - High proportion of anergic B cells in the bone marrow defined phenotypically by 
      CD21(-/low)/CD38- expression predicts poor survival in diffuse large B cell 
      lymphoma.
PG  - 1061

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the commonest lymphoma that is 
      highly aggressive where one-third of the patients relapse despite effective 
      treatment. Interaction between the lymphoma cells and the non-clonal immune cells 
      within the bone marrow microenvironment is thought to play a critical role in the 
      pathogenesis of DLBCL. METHODS: We used flow cytometry to characterize the 
      proportion of B cell subpopulations in the bone marrow (N = 47) and peripheral blood 
      (N = 54) of 75 DLBCL patients at diagnosis and study their impact on survival. 
      RESULTS: Anergic B cells in the bone marrow (BM), characterized as having 
      CD21(-/low)/CD38- expression, influenced survival with high numbers (defined as 
      > 13.9%) being associated with significantly shorter overall survival (59.7 months 
      vs 113.6 months, p = 0.0038). Interestingly, low numbers of anergic B cells in the 
      BM (defined as ≤13.9%) was associated with germinal center B cell type of DLBCL 
      (p = 0.0354) that is known to have superior rates of survival when compared to 
      activated B cell type. Finally, Cox regression analysis in our cohort of patients 
      established that the inferior prognosis of having high numbers of anergic B cells in 
      the bone marrow was independent of the established Revised International Prognostic 
      Index (R-IPI) score. CONCLUSIONS: High proportion of anergic B cells in the BM 
      characterized by CD21(-/low)/CD38- expression predicts poor survival outcomes in 
      DLBCL.

TI  - Age-Associated B Cells (ABCs) in the Prognosis, Diagnosis and Therapy of Systemic 
      Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
PG  - 311-318
LID - 10.31138/mjr.31.3.311 [doi]
AB  - The term "age-associated B cells" (ABCs) refers to a heterogeneous B cell subset 
      (CD19(+),CD21(-), CD11c(+),T-bet(+)) which is expanded in the elderly, but also 
      accumulates prematurely in patients with autoimmune disorders and/or infectious 
      diseases. In healthy individuals, ABCs represent a low prevalence population that 
      positively impacts immunosenescence. In autoimmunity and infections though, ABCs 
      expand dramatically and produce high titers of antibodies, thus playing a role in 
      the regulation of humoral responses. Despite the fact that these observations were 
      made on both mice and humans, the functional features of ABCs and their exact role 
      in human health and disease are still elusive. This review focuses on ABC and 
      ABC-like sub-populations found in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients (such 
      as the double negative 2;DN2 population: CD19(+),IgD(-),CD27(-), CXCR5(-),T-bet(+)) 
      and broaches the subject of their potential use as prognostic and/or diagnostic 
      markers. The identification of novel biomarkers, via correlating the cell 
      populations with the clinical profile of the patients, should enable better patient 
      stratification and monitoring. Moreover, the necessity and importance of elucidating 
      the role of transcription factor T-bet (TBX21) in the pathogenesis of human 
      autoimmunity are addressed. T-bet, whose expression is upregulated in both mouse and 
      human ABCs, is considered to play a major role in various aspects of autoimmunity, 
      such as the production of autoreactive IgG, the enhanced antigen presentation to T 
      cells and also the formation of spontaneous germinal centres (GC). Shedding light to 
      its role in human disease, in conjunction with the characterisation of genes and 
      pathways associated with the transcription factor itself, may lead to the discovery 
      of novel druggable targets.

AB  - The naive heart harbors a population of intravascular B cells that make close 
      contact with the cardiac microvasculature. However, the timing of their appearance 
      and their organ specificity remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we 
      performed a systematic analysis of B cells isolated from the myocardium and other 
      organs, from embryonic life to adulthood. We found that the phenotype of myocardial 
      B cells changed dynamically during development. While neonatal heart B cells were 
      mostly CD11b+ and CD11b- CD21-CD23-, adult B cells were predominantly 
      CD11b-CD21+CD23+. Histological analysis and intravital microscopy of lung and liver 
      showed that organ-associated B cells in contact with the microvascular endothelium 
      were not specific to the heart. Flow cytometric analysis of perfused hearts, livers, 
      lungs, and spleen showed that the dynamic changes in B cell subpopulations observed 
      in the heart during development mirrored changes observed in the other organs. 
      Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis of B cells showed that myocardial B 
      cells were part of a larger population of organ-associated B cells that had a 
      distinct transcriptional profile. These findings broaden our understanding of the 
      biology of myocardial-associated B cells and suggest that current models of the 
      dynamics of naive B cells during development are incomplete.

TI  - The aging common marmoset's immune system: From junior to senior.
PG  - e23128
LID - 10.1002/ajp.23128 [doi]
AB  - The social, health, and economic challenges of a steadily increasing aging 
      population demand the use of appropriate translational animal models to address 
      questions like healthy aging, vaccination strategies, or potential interventions 
      during the aging process. Due to their genetic proximity to humans, especially 
      nonhuman primates (NHPs) with a relatively short generation period compared to 
      humans, qualify as excellent animal models for these purposes. The use of common 
      marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) in gerontology research steadily increased over the 
      last decades, yet important information about their aging parameters are still 
      missing. We therefore aimed to characterize their aging immune system by 
      comprehensive flow cytometric phenotyping of blood immune cells from juvenile, 
      adult, aging, and geriatric animals. Aged and geriatric animals displayed clear 
      signs of immunosenescence. A decline in CD4/CD8 ratio, increased expression of 
      HLA-DR and PD-1, higher frequencies of CD95(+) memory cells, alterations in cytokine 
      secretion, and a decline in the proliferative capacity proved T cell senescence in 
      aging marmosets. Also, the B cell compartment was affected by age-related changes: 
      while overall B cell numbers remained stable with advancing age, expression of the 
      activation marker CD80 increased and immunoglobulin M expression decreased. 
      Interestingly, marmoset B cell memory subset distribution rather mirrored the human 
      situation than that of other NHP. CD21(+) CD27(-) naïve B cell frequencies decreased 
      while those of CD21(-) CD27(-) tissue memory B cells increased with age. 
      Furthermore, frequencies and numbers of NK cells as part of the innate immune system 
      declined with advancing age. Thus, the observed immunological changes in common 
      marmosets over their life span revealed several similarities to age-related changes 
      in humans and encourages further studies to strengthen the common marmoset as a 
      potential aging model.

AB  - Immunological research in pigs benefits from many improvements with a direct impact 
      on the veterinary control of pig husbandry and on biomedical models. We compiled the 
      available knowledge to develop gating strategies to monitor simultaneously all blood 
      immune cell types by multicolor flow cytometry in Melanoblastoma-bearing Libechov 
      Minipigs (MeLiM). The MeLiM pig spontaneously develops cutaneous melanomas that 
      regress few months later. We monitored lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets in 3 to 21 
      weeks old pigs. Interestingly, neutrophils, type III monocytes (CD163(+) CD14(+) MHC 
      II(-)) and CD4(-) CD8α(-) T cells are less abundant in oldest animals in contrast to 
      eosinophils, type II monocytes (CD163(-) CD14(low) MHC II(+)), B cells, γδ T cells, 
      CD4(+) CD8α(+) and CD4(-) CD8α(+) T cells. Melanoma occurrence led to changes in the 
      blood cell composition. Higher proportions of NK cells, CD4(+) and CD4(+) CD8α(+) T 
      cells, and CD21(-) B cells among B cells are found in young melanoma-bearing 
      piglets, consistent with the immune-mediated spontaneous regression in the MeLiM 
      model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-transplantation pharmacotherapies typically employ combinations of 
      immunosuppressive agents that have been designed for targeted inhibition of T-cells 
      and T-cell subsets. Studies of acute and chronic effects of clinically employed 
      immunosuppressive agents on B-cells and B-cell subsets are significantly fewer in 
      number and warrant further investigation. Accordingly, the goal of the present 
      cross-sectional study is to functionally evaluate differences of B-cell subsets in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and immunologically stable renal 
      transplant patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 103 patients who underwent renal 
      transplantation, 73 patients were immunologically stable without rejection or 
      infection. Among them, 34 patients were one-year post-transplantation, and 39 
      patients were five-year post-transplantation. The study also included 35 ESRD 
      patients and 36 healthy volunteers. Flow cytometry identified B-cell subsets in the 
      study groups. RESULTS: Renal allograft recipients had reduced percentages of total 
      B-cells (CD19+) and regulatory B-cells (B(reg)) (CD38(high)CD27 + CD24+) compared 
      with healthy controls. The percentage of transitional B-cells 
      (IgM + CD38(high)CD24(high)) and marginal zone (MZ) B-cells (IgD-CD27+) was reduced 
      in transplant recipients compared with patients with ESRD and healthy volunteers. 
      The highest percentage of plasma cells (PCs) (CD38(high)CD27 + CD24-) was in 
      patients with ESRD. In five-year post-transplantation group, CD38(low)CD21- B-cells 
      increased when compared with the other groups. Healthy volunteers and patients with 
      ESRD had fewer unswitched memory (UM) B-cells (IgM + IgD + CD38(low)CD27+), and 
      increased isotype switched memory (ISM) B-cells (IgM-IgD-CD38(low)CD27+). There was 
      no difference in the percentage of naïve B-cells (IgD + CD27-) among diverse groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of the total, transitional, B(reg), PCs, MZ, and UM 
      B-cell subsets in immunologically stable renal allograft recipients were 
      significantly different from healthy controls. However, B-cell subsets in patients 
      with ESRD were minimally different with immunologically stable renal allograft 
      recipients.

TI  - Understanding the Heterogeneous Population of Age-Associated B Cells and Their 
      Contributions to Autoimmunity and Immune Response to Pathogens.
PG  - 297-309
LID - 10.1615/CritRevImmunol.2020034934 [doi]
AB  - In humans and mice, susceptibility to infections and autoimmunity increases with age 
      due to age-associated changes in innate and adaptive immune responses. Aged innate 
      cells are also less active, leading to decreased naive T- and B-cell responses. 
      Aging innate cells contribute to an overall heightened inflammatory environment. 
      Naive T and B cells undergo cell-intrinsic age-related changes that result in 
      reduced effector and memory responses. However, previously established B- and T-cell 
      memory responses persist with age. One dramatic change is the appearance of a newly 
      recognized population of age-associated B cells (ABCs) that has a unique cluster of 
      differentiation (CD)21-CD23- phenotype. Here, we discuss the discovery and origins 
      of the naive phenotype immunoglobulin (Ig)D+ versus activated CD11c+T-bet+ ABCs, 
      with a focus on protective and pathogenic properties. In humans and mice, 
      antigen-experienced CD11c+T-bet+ ABCs increase with autoimmunity and appear in 
      response to bacterial and viral infections. However, our analyses indicate that 
      CD21-CD23- ABCs include a resting, naive, progenitor ABC population that expresses 
      IgD. Similar to generation of CD11c+T-bet+ ABCs, naive ABC response to pathogens 
      depends on toll-like receptor stimulation, making this a key feature of ABC 
      activation. Here, we put forward a potential developmental map of distinct subsets 
      from putative naive ABCs. We suggest that defining signals that can harness the 
      naive ABC response may contribute to protection against pathogens in the elderly. 
      CD11c+T-bet+ ABCs may be useful targets for therapeutic strategies to counter 
      autoimmunity.

TI  - Impaired ATM activation in B cells is associated with bone resorption in rheumatoid 
      arthritis.

AB  - Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may display atypical CD21(-/lo) B cells in 
      their blood, but the implication of this observation remains unclear. We report here 
      that the group of patients with RA and elevated frequencies of CD21(-/lo) B cells 
      shows decreased ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) expression and activation in B 
      cells compared with other patients with RA and healthy donor controls. In agreement 
      with ATM involvement in the regulation of V(D)J recombination, patients with RA who 
      show defective ATM function displayed a skewed B cell receptor (BCR) Igκ repertoire, 
      which resembled that of patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT). This repertoire 
      was characterized by increased Jκ1 and decreased upstream Vκ gene segment usage, 
      suggesting improper secondary recombination processes and selection. In addition, 
      altered ATM function in B cells was associated with decreased osteoprotegerin and 
      increased receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) production. These 
      changes favor bone loss and correlated with a higher prevalence of erosive disease 
      in patients with RA who show impaired ATM function. Using a humanized mouse model, 
      we also show that ATM inhibition in vivo induces an altered Igκ repertoire and RANKL 
      production by immature B cells in the bone marrow, leading to decreased bone 
      density. We conclude that dysregulated ATM function in B cells promotes bone erosion 
      and the emergence of circulating CD21(-/lo) B cells, thereby contributing to RA 
      pathophysiology.

TI  - Impaired B-cell tolerance checkpoints promote the development of autoimmune diseases 
      and pathogenic autoantibodies.
PG  - 90-101
LID - 10.1111/imr.12821 [doi]
AB  - A role for B cells in autoimmune diseases is now clearly established both in mouse 
      models and humans by successful treatment of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid 
      arthritis with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies that eliminate B cells. However, the 
      underlying mechanisms by which B cells promote the development of autoimmune 
      diseases remain poorly understood. Here, we review evidence that patients with 
      autoimmune disease suffer from defects in early B-cell tolerance checkpoints and 
      therefore fail to counterselect developing autoreactive B cells. These B-cell 
      tolerance defects are primary to autoimmune diseases and may result from altered 
      B-cell receptor signaling and dysregulated T-cell/regulatory T-cell compartment. As 
      a consequence, large numbers of autoreactive naive B cells accumulate in the blood 
      of patients with autoimmune diseases and may promote autoimmunity through the 
      presentation of self-antigen to T cells. In addition, new evidence suggests that 
      this reservoir of autoreactive naive B cells contains clones that may develop into 
      CD27(-) CD21(-/lo) B cells associated with increased disease severity and plasma 
      cells secreting potentially pathogenic autoantibodies after the acquisition of 
      somatic hypermutations that improve affinity for self-antigens.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection contributes to the development 
      of autoimmune disorders such as cryoglobulinaemia vasculitis (CV). However, it 
      remains unclear why only some individuals with HCV develop HCV-associated CV 
      (HCV-CV). HCV-CV is characterized by the expansion of anergic 
      CD19(+)CD27(+)CD21(low/-) atypical memory B cells (AtMs). Herein, we report the 
      mechanisms by which AtMs participate in HCV-associated autoimmunity. METHODS: The 
      phenotype and function of peripheral AtMs were studied by multicolour flow cytometry 
      and co-culture assays with effector T cells and regulatory T cells in 20 patients 
      with HCV-CV, 10 chronicallyHCV-infected patients without CV and 8 healthy donors. We 
      performed gene expression profile analysis of AtMs stimulated or not by TLR9. 
      Immunoglobulin gene repertoire and antibody reactivity profiles of AtM-expressing 
      IgM antibodies were analysed following single B cell FACS sorting and 
      expression-cloning of monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The 
      Tbet(+)CD11c(+)CD27(+)CD21(-) AtM population is expanded in patients with HCV-CV 
      compared to HCV controls without CV. TLR9 activation of AtMs induces a specific 
      transcriptional signature centred on TNFα overexpression, and an enhanced secretion 
      of TNFα and rheumatoid factor-type IgMs in patients with HCV-CV. AtMs stimulated 
      through TLR9 promote type 1 effector T cell activation and reduce the proliferation 
      of CD4(+)CD25(hi)CD127(-/low)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells. AtM expansions display 
      intraclonal diversity with immunoglobulin features of antigen-driven maturation. 
      AtM-derived IgM monoclonal antibodies do not react against ubiquitous autoantigens 
      or HCV antigens including NS3 and E2 proteins. Rather, AtM-derived antibodies 
      possess rheumatoid factor activity and target unique epitopes on the human IgG-Fc 
      region. CONCLUSION: Our data strongly suggest a central role for TLR9 activation of 
      AtMs in driving HCV-CV autoimmunity through rheumatoid factor production and type 1 
      T cell responses. LAY SUMMARY: B cells are best known for their capacity to produce 
      antibodies, which often play a deleterious role in the development of autoimmune 
      diseases. During chronic hepatitis C, self-reactive B cells proliferate and can be 
      responsible for autoimmune symptoms (arthritis, purpura, neuropathy, renal disease) 
      and/or lymphoma. Direct-acting antiviral therapy clears the hepatitis C virus and 
      eliminates deleterious B cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a cell-mediated 
      immune defense mechanism in which effector immune cells actively lyse 
      antibody-coated target cells. The ADCC of tumor cells is employed in the treatment 
      of various cancers overexpressing unique antigens, and only natural killer (NK) 
      cells are known to be major effectors of antibody mediated ADCC activity. Canine NK 
      cells are still defined as non-B, non-T large granular lymphocytes because of the 
      lack of information regarding the NK cell-restricted specific marker in dogs, and it 
      has never been demonstrated that canine NK cells have ADCC ability against tumor 
      cells. In the present study, we investigated whether canine non-B, non-T NK cells 
      have ADCC ability against target antibody-coated tumor cells, using cetuximab and 
      trastuzumab, the only human antibodies reported binding to canine cancer cells. 
      RESULTS: Activated canine non-B, non-T NK cells 
      (CD3(-)CD21(-)CD5(-)TCRαβ(-)TCRγδ(-)) for 13~17 days ex vivo showed ADCC ability 
      against trastuzumab- or cetuximab-coated target tumor cells expressing various 
      levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and epidermal growth 
      factor receptor (EGFR). Trastuzumab and cetuximab induced significant ADCC responses 
      of canine NK cells even in CMT-U334 and CF41.Mg cells expressing low levels of HER-2 
      and/or EGFR, as well as in SKBR3 and DU145 cells overexpressing HER-2 and/or EGFR. 
      The trastuzumab-mediated ADCC activity of NK cells was significantly enhanced by 
      treatment with rcIL-21. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that canine 
      non-B, non-T NK lymphocytes have a potential ADCC function and that combinational 
      strategies of monoclonal antibodies with either cytokines, which activate NK cells 
      in vivo, or adoptive transfer of NK cells may be a feasible method for amplifying 
      the efficacy of immunotherapy against malignant cancers even with very low 
      expression of target molecules in dogs.

      Development and Function at Multiple Stages.

AB  - The FOXP1 transcription factor is expressed throughout B cell development until its 
      extinction just prior to terminal differentiation. Foxp1 nulls die of cardiac 
      defects at midgestation, but adult rescue via fetal liver transfer led to a strong 
      pre-B cell block. To circumvent these limitations and to investigate FOXP1 function 
      at later stages of B cell differentiation, we generated and analyzed floxed (F) 
      Foxp1 alleles deleted at pro-B, transitional (T) 1, and mature B cell stages. 
      Mb-1cre-mediated deletion of Foxp1(F/F) confirmed its requirement for pro-B to pre-B 
      transition. Cd21- and Cd19cre deletion led to significant reduction of germinal 
      center formation and a second block in differentiation at the T2/marginal zone 
      precursor stage. T-dependent and -independent immunization of FOXP1 mutants led to 
      reduction of Ag-specific IgM, whereas responses of class-switched Abs were 
      unimpaired. Yet, unexpectedly, plasmablast and plasma cell numbers were 
      significantly increased by in vitro BCR stimulation of Foxp1(F/F) splenic follicular 
      B cells but rapidly lost, as they were highly prone to apoptosis. RNA sequencing, 
      gene set enrichment analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses 
      revealed strong enrichment for signatures related to downregulation of immune 
      responses, apoptosis, and germinal center biology, including direct activation of 
      Bcl6 and downregulation of Aicda/AID, the primary effector of somatic hypermutation, 
      and class-switch recombination. These observations support a role for FOXP1 as a 
      direct transcriptional regulator at key steps underlying B cell development in the 
      mouse.

      Changes Associated With Genetic Immunodeficiency Disorders.

AB  - Genetic primary immunodeficiency diseases are increasingly recognized, with 
      pathogenic mutations changing the composition of circulating leukocyte subsets 
      measured by flow cytometry (FCM). Discerning changes in multiple subpopulations is 
      challenging, and subtle trends might be missed if traditional reference ranges 
      derived from a control population are applied. We developed an algorithm where 
      centiles were allocated using non-parametric comparison to controls, generating 
      multiparameter heat maps to simultaneously represent all leukocyte subpopulations 
      for inspection of trends within a cohort or segregation with a putative genetic 
      mutation. To illustrate this method, we analyzed patients with Primary Antibody 
      Deficiency (PAD) and kindreds harboring mutations in TNFRSF13B (encoding TACI), 
      CTLA4, and CARD11. In PAD, loss of switched memory B cells (B-SM) was readily 
      demonstrated, but as a continuous, not dichotomous, variable. Expansion of 
      CXCR5+/CD45RA- CD4+ T cells (X5-Th cells) was a prominent feature in PAD, 
      particularly in TACI mutants, and patients with expansion in CD21-lo B cells or 
      transitional B cells were readily apparent. We observed differences between 
      unaffected and affected TACI mutants (increased B cells and CD8+ T-effector memory 
      cells, loss of B-SM cells and non-classical monocytes), cellular signatures that 
      distinguished CTLA4 haploinsufficiency itself (expansion of plasmablasts, activated 
      CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells, and X5-Th cells) from its clinical expression 
      (B-cell depletion), and those that were associated with CARD11 gain-of-function 
      mutation (decreased CD8+ T effector memory cells, B cells, CD21-lo B cells, B-SM 
      cells, and NK cells). Co-efficients of variation exceeded 30% for 36/54 FCM 
      parameters, but by comparing inter-assay variation with disease-related variation, 
      we ranked each parameter in terms of laboratory precision vs. disease variability, 
      identifying X5-Th cells (and derivatives), naïve, activated, and central memory CD8+ 
      T cells, transitional B cells, memory and SM-B cells, plasmablasts, activated CD4 
      cells, and total T cells as the 10 most useful cellular parameters. Applying these 
      to cluster analysis of our PAD cohort, we could detect subgroups with the potential 
      to reflect underlying genotypes. Heat mapping of normalized FCM data reveals 
      cellular trends missed by standard reference ranges, identifies changes associating 
      with a phenotype or genotype, and could inform hypotheses regarding pathogenesis of 
      genetic immunodeficiency.

TI  - Apical membrane protein 1-specific antibody profile and temporal changes in 
      peripheral blood B-cell populations in Plasmodium vivax malaria.
PG  - e12662
LID - 10.1111/pim.12662 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum-specific antibodies tend to be short-lived, but their cognate 
      memory B cells (MBCs) circulate in the peripheral blood of exposed subjects for 
      several months or years after the last infection. However, the time course of 
      antigen-specific antibodies and B-cell responses to the relatively neglected 
      parasite Plasmodium vivax remains largely unexplored. Here, we showed that 
      uncomplicated vivax malaria elicits short-lived antibodies but long-lived MBC 
      responses to a major blood-stage P vivax antigen, apical membrane protein 1 
      (PvAMA-1), in subjects exposed to declining malaria transmission in the Amazon Basin 
      of Brazil. We found that atypical (CD19(+) CD10(-) CD21(-) CD27(-) ) MBCs, which 
      appear to share a common precursor with classical MBCs but are unable to 
      differentiate into antibody-secreting cells, significantly outnumbered classical 
      MBCs by 5:1 in the peripheral blood of adult subjects currently or recently infected 
      with P vivax and by 3:1 in healthy residents in the same endemic communities. We 
      concluded that malaria can drive classical MBCs to differentiate into functionally 
      impaired MBCs not only in subjects repeatedly exposed to P falciparum, but also in 
      subjects living in areas with low levels of P vivax transmission in the Amazon, 
      leading to an impaired B-cell memory that may affect both naturally acquired and 
      vaccine-induced immunity.

TI  - Impacts of GFP-FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells on lupus hallmarks differ by genetic 
      background and type of GFP knock-in.
PG  - 199-207
LID - 10.1080/08916934.2019.1657098 [doi]
AB  - FoxP3 reporter mice expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) have been used as a 
      very convenient tool to investigate the impact of regulatory T (Treg) cells on 
      pathogenesis in autoimmune diseases. Here, we found that GFP-FoxP3(+) knock-in (KI) 
      mice showed alterations in the production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) and 
      nephritis with different extent, depending on the presence or absence of lupus 
      susceptibility gene locus 1 (Sle1) and KI method: contrasting with 
      B6.Sle1.fGFP-FoxP3 mice, expressing GFP via N-terminal insertion, 
      B6.Sle1.iGFP-FoxP3, expressing GFP via bicistronic internal ribosome entry 
      site-driven promotion, exhibited significantly lower penetrance of serum ANA, 
      comparing to control B6.Sle1 mice. Moreover, B6.Sle1.GFP-FoxP3(+) mice reduced the 
      Sle1-induced splenomegaly and B-cell expansion independently of the KI method 
      employed, mainly by reducing the numbers of transitional 1 (T1) B cells and 
      CD21(-)CD23(-) B cells, including plasmablasts and plasma cells. The absolute 
      numbers of both splenic CD4(+) T cells and Treg cells from B6.Sle1.GFP-FoxP3 KI mice 
      were significantly reduced but their proportion was not changed, compared to B6.Sle1 
      mice. Although the glomerular basement membranes were thickened in both B6.Sle1 and 
      B6.Sle1.iGFP-FoxP3 mice, they were thinner in B6.Sle1.fGFP-FoxP3 mice. The latter 
      mice expressed more nephrophilic autoantibodies and deposited more complement 
      component 3 in glomeruli compared to B6.iGFP-FoxP3 mice. FoxP3(+) Treg cells may 
      modulate B-cell tolerance in lupus-prone B6.Sle1 mice, presumably by modulating 
      pathogenic, nephrophilic autoantibody production and nephritis.

TI  - CD21(-/low) B cells associate with joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
PG  - e12792
LID - 10.1111/sji.12792 [doi]
AB  - Depletion of B cells is beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with 
      autoantibodies to citrullinated proteins (ACPA) and/or the Fc portion of 
      immunoglobulins (rheumatoid factor [RF]), suggesting a role for B cells in disease 
      pathogenesis. To date, however, the identity of specifically pathogenic B cell 
      subsets has not been discovered. One candidate population is identified by the low 
      expression or absence of complement receptor 2 (CD21(-/low) B cells). In this study, 
      we sought to determine whether there was any correlation between CD21(-/low) B cells 
      and clinical outcome in patients with established RA, either ACPA(+) /RF(+) (n = 27) 
      or ACPA(-) /RF(-) (n = 10). Healthy donors (n = 17) were included as controls. The 
      proportion of the CD21(-/low) CD27(-) IgD(-) memory B cell subset in peripheral 
      blood (PB) was significantly increased in ACPA(+) /RF(+) RA patients compared with 
      healthy donors, and the frequency of this subset correlated with joint destruction 
      (r = 0.57, P < 0.04). The levels of the chemokines CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 were higher in 
      synovial fluid than in plasma, and PB CD21(-/low) cells expressed the receptor, 
      CXCR3. In synovial fluid, most of the B cells were CD21(-/low) , approximately 40% 
      of that population was CD27(-) IgD(-) , and a third of those expressed the 
      pro-osteoclastogenic factor receptor activator of the nuclear factor κB ligand 
      (RANKL). This subset also secreted RANKL, in addition to other factors such as IL-6, 
      even in the absence of stimulation. We interpret these data as reason to propose the 
      hypothesis that the CD27(-) IgD(-) subset of CD21(-/low) B cells may mediate joint 
      destruction in patients with ACPA(+) /RF(+) RA.

AB  - The subset of pro-inflammatory B cells, called late memory, tissue-like or double 
      negative (DN), accumulates in the blood of elderly individuals. Here we show that DN 
      B cells do not proliferate and do not make antibodies to influenza antigens, but 
      they secrete antibodies with autoimmune reactivity, in agreement with their membrane 
      phenotype (CD95+CD21-CD11c+) and their spontaneous expression of the transcription 
      factor T-bet. These cells also increase in the blood of individuals with obesity and 
      autoimmune diseases, but causative mechanisms and signaling pathways involved are 
      known only in part. In the present paper we compare frequencies and metabolic 
      requirements of these cells in the blood of healthy individuals of different ages 
      and in the blood and the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of individuals with 
      obesity. Results show that DN B cells from young individuals have minimal metabolic 
      requirements, DN B cells from elderly and obese individuals utilize higher amounts 
      of glucose to perform autoimmune antibody production and enroll in aerobic 
      glycolysis to support their function. DN B cells from the SAT have the highest 
      metabolic requirements as they activate oxidative phosphorylation, aerobic 
      glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. DN B cells from the SAT also show the highest 
      levels of ROS and the highest levels of phosphorylated AMPK (5'-AMP activated 
      kinase) and Sestrin 1, both able to mitigate stress and cell death. This metabolic 
      advantage drives DN B cell survival and function (secretion of autoimmune 
      antibodies).

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are non-T, non-B lymphocytes are part of the innate immune 
      system and function without prior activation. The human NK cell surface determinant, 
      CD94, plays a critical role in regulation of NK cell activity as a heterodimer with 
      NKG2 subclasses. Canine NK cells are not as well defined as the human and murine 
      equivalents, due in part to the paucity of reagents specific to cell surface 
      markers. Canines possess NK/NKT cells that have similar morphological 
      characteristics to those found in humans, yet little is known about their functional 
      characteristics nor of cell surface expression of CD94. Here, we describe the 
      development and function of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to canine (ca) CD94. Freshly 
      isolated canine CD94(+) cells were CD3(+/-), CD8(+/-), CD4-, CD21-, CD5(low), 
      NKp46(+), and were cytotoxic against a canine target cell line. Anti-caCD94 mAb 
      proved useful in enriching NK/NKT cells from PBMC for expansion on CTAC feeder cells 
      in the presence of IL-2 and IL-15. The cultured cells were highly cytolytic with 
      co-expression of NKp46 and reduced expression of CD3. Transmission electron 
      microscopy revealed expanded CD94(+) lymphocytes were morphologically large granular 
      lymphocytes with large electron dense granules. Anti-caCD94 (mAb) can serve to 
      enrich NK/NKT cells from dog peripheral blood for ex vivo expansion for HCT and is a 
      potentially valuable reagent for studying NK/NKT regulation in the dog.

TI  - Differential expression of estrogen receptor-α on follicular dendritic cells from 
      patients with grade 1-2 and grade 3 follicular lymphoma.
PG  - 151-159

AB  - Hormone therapy has been used for patients with estrogen receptor alpha 
      (ERα)-positive breast cancers. Recently, some studies reported the expression of ERα 
      on neoplastic cells from B-cell lymphomas. However, there has been only one report 
      of ERα expression on the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) that structurally and 
      functionally support the microenvironment of follicular lymphomas (FLs). The 
      objective of this study was to investigate the frequency of ERα expression on FDCs 
      in nonneoplastic reactive lymphoid tissues and to compare the frequency of ERα 
      expression on FDCs in the axillary lymph nodes between patients with and without 
      antiestrogen therapy and among patients with grades 1-3 of FL. Reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect ERα mRNA in FL. In 
      nonneoplastic germinal centers (GCs) from patients with tonsillitis or reactive 
      lymphadenitis, ERα was expressed in the light zone. ERα-positive cells strongly 
      correlated with the width of GCs (r(s)  = 0.81, P < 0.01) and the CD21-positive 
      (r(s)  = 0.69, P < 0.01) and CD23-positive (r(s)  = 0.83, P < 0.01) FDC meshwork. 
      The axillary lymph nodes had fewer ERα-positive cells, smaller GCs, and a looser 
      CD21- and CD23-positive FDC meshwork with hormone therapy than without hormone 
      therapy (P < 0.01). Neoplastic follicles of G1-2 FL had more ERα-positive cells and 
      a larger CD23(+) FDC meshwork than those of G3 FL (P < 0.01). ERα mRNA was detected 
      in both G1-2 FL and G3 FL by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In 
      conclusion, these results suggested that antiestrogen hormone therapy may decrease 
      the number of ERα-positive FDCs and that the responses mediated by the estrogen-ERα 
      interaction on FDCs may differ between G1-2 FL and G3 FL.

AB  - Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are key players in immune evasion, tumor 
      progression and metastasis. MDSCs accumulate under various pathological states and 
      fall into two functionally and phenotypically distinct subsets that have been 
      identified in humans and mice: polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs and monocytic 
      (M)-MDSCs. As dogs are an excellent model for human tumor development and 
      progression, we set out to identify PMN-MDSCs and M-MDSCs in clinical canine 
      oncology patients. Canine hypodense MHC class II(-)CD5(-)CD21(-)CD11b(+) cells can 
      be subdivided into polymorphonuclear (CADO48A(+)CD14(-)) and monocytic 
      (CADO48A(-)CD14(+)) MDSC subsets. The transcriptomic signatures of PMN-MDSCs and 
      M-MDSCs are distinct, and moreover reveal a statistically significant similarity 
      between canine and previously published human PMN-MDSC gene expression patterns. As 
      in humans, peripheral blood frequencies of canine PMN-MDSCs and M-MDSCs are 
      significantly higher in dogs with cancer compared to healthy control dogs 
      (PMN-MDSCs: p < 0.001; M-MDSCs: p < 0.01). By leveraging the power of evolution, we 
      also identified additional conserved genes in PMN-MDSCs of multiple species that may 
      play a role in MDSC function. Our findings therefore validate the dog as a model for 
      studying MDSCs in the context of cancer.

TI  - Follicular helper T cell and memory B cell immunity in CHC patients.
PG  - 397-407

AB  - Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is associated with biological activity of T follicular 
      helper (Tfh) cells and memory B cells (MBCs). However, the nature of Tfh cell 
      subsets that are responsible for MBCs in CHC patients has not been evaluated. This 
      study aimed to investigate Tfh and MBC immunity before and after direct-acting 
      antiviral (DAA) therapy in patients with CHC. A total of 31 CHC patients and 15 
      healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Individual patients were treated with 
      sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SOF/RBV) or in combination with pegylated interferon alpha-2a 
      (PEG-IFN-α-2a) for 12 weeks. Immunofluorescence revealed the frequency of 
      ICOS(+)CD4(+)CXCR5(+) active Tfh cells in liver tissue of CHC patients was higher 
      than that of healthy control. Tfh and B cell co-culture experiments showed that Tfh2 
      cells from CHC patients have potential ability to induce B cell differentiation and 
      IgG production. Flow cytometry showed that the frequencies of CD21(-)CD27(+)IgD(-) 
      activated MBCs, ICOS(+)CD4(+)CXCR5(+) activated Tfh cells, Tfh1 
      (IFN-γ(+)CD4(+)CXCR5(+)) cells, and Tfh2 (IL-4(+)CD4(+)CXCR5(+)) cells, but not of 
      Tfh17 (IL-17(+)CD4(+)CXCR5(+)) cells, increased in CHC patients before and after DAA 
      therapy. Collectively, ICOS(+) Tfh, Tfh1, Tfh2 cells, and MBCs participated in the 
      antiviral treatment process of SOF/RBV with or without PEG-IFN-α-2a in CHC patients, 
      and their activity was further enhanced during the treatment. KEY MESSAGES: This 
      study aimed to investigate Tfh cells and MBC immunity in CHC patients. 
      CD21(-)CD27(+)IgD(-) activated MBCs increased in CHC patients before and after 
      treatment. Tfh1 and Tfh2 cells increased in CHC patients before and after antiviral 
      treatment. Intrahepatic activated Tfh cells increased in CHC patients before 
      treatment. Tfh2 cells from CHC patients have a stronger ability to induce B cell 
      differentiation.

AB  - Ataxia-Telangiectasia (AT) is an immunodeficiency most often associated with T cell 
      abnormalities. We describe a patient with a hyper-IgM phenotype and immune cell 
      abnormalities that suggest a distinct clinical phenotype. Significant B cell 
      abnormalities with increased unswitched memory B cells, decreased naive transitional 
      B cells, and an elevated frequency of CD19(+)CD38(lo)CD27(-)CD10(-)CD21(-/low) B 
      cells expressing high levels of T-bet and Fas were demonstrated. The B cells were 
      hyporesponsive to in vitro stimulation through the B cell receptor, Toll like 
      receptors (TLR) 7 and 9, and CD40. T cell homeostasis was also disturbed with a 
      significant increase in γδ T cells, circulating T follicular helper cells (Tfh), and 
      decreased numbers of T regulatory cells. The ATM mutations in this patient are 
      posited to have resulted in the perturbations in the frequencies and distributions 
      of B and T cell subsets, resulting in the phenotype in this patient. KEY MESSAGES: A 
      novel mutation creating a premature stop codon and a nonsense mutation in the ATM 
      gene are postulated to have resulted in the unique clinical picture characterized by 
      abnormal B and T cell populations, lymphocyte subset dysfunction, granuloma 
      formation, and a hyper-IgM phenotype. CAPSULE SUMMARY: A patient presented with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia, cutaneous granulomas, and a hyper-IgM phenotype; a novel 
      combination of mutations in the ATM gene was associated with abnormal distributions, 
      frequencies, and function of T and B lymphocyte subsets.

AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonizes the human lower intestinal and genital tracts 
      and constitutes a major threat to neonates from pregnant carrier mothers and to 
      adults with underlying morbidity. The pathogen expresses cell-surface virulence 
      factors that enable cell adhesion and penetration and that counteract innate and 
      adaptive immune responses. Among these, the complement interfering protein (CIP) was 
      recently described for its capacity to interact with the human C4b ligand and to 
      interfere with the classical- and lectin-complement pathways. In the present study, 
      we provide evidence that CIP can also interact with C3, C3b, and C3d. 
      Immunoassay-based competition experiments showed that binding of CIP to C3d 
      interferes with the interaction between C3d and the complement receptor 2/cluster of 
      differentiation 21 (CR2/CD21) receptor on B cells. By B-cell intracellular signaling 
      assays, CIP was confirmed to down-regulate CR2/CD21-dependent B-cell activation. The 
      CIP domain involved in C3d binding was mapped via hydrogen deuterium exchange-mass 
      spectrometry. The data obtained reveal a new role for this GBS polypeptide at the 
      interface between the innate and adaptive immune responses, adding a new member to 
      the growing list of virulence factors secreted by gram-positive pathogens that 
      incorporate multiple immunomodulatory functions.-Giussani, S., Pietrocola, G.,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease, 
      which exhibits multiple B cell abnormalities including expanded populations of 
      memory B cells and elevated levels of autoantibodies. Belimumab is a monoclonal 
      antibody targeting the B cell cytokine BAFF (a.k.a. BLyS), approved for the 
      treatment of SLE. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, B cells from peripheral 
      blood of 23 SLE patients initiating belimumab treatment and followed longitudinally 
      for up to three years, were assessed using mass cytometry. FINDINGS: B cells 
      decreased during the study period, with a rapid decrease of both naïve and 
      CD11c(+)CD21(-) B cells at the first follow-up visit, followed by a continuous 
      reduction at subsequent follow-ups. In contrast, plasma cells and switched memory B 
      cells remained stable throughout the study. The observed immunological changes 
      correlated with early, but not late, clinical improvements. Moreover, high baseline 
      B cell counts were predictive of failure to attain low disease activity. In summary, 
      our data unveiled both rapid and gradual later therapy-associated alterations of 
      both known and unforeseen B cell phenotypes. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest 
      that evaluation of B cell counts might prove useful prior to initiation of belimumab 
      treatment and that early treatment evaluation and discontinuation might 
      underestimate delayed clinical improvements resultant of late B cell changes.

AB  - B lymphocytes are important players in immune responses to cancer. However, their 
      composition and function in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has not 
      been well described. Here, we analyzed B cell subsets in HNSCC (n = 38), 
      non-cancerous mucosa (n = 14) and peripheral blood from HNSCC patients (n = 38) and 
      healthy controls (n = 20) by flow cytometry. Intratumoral B cells contained high 
      percentages of activated (CD86(+)), antigen-presenting (CD86(+)/CD21(-)) and memory 
      B cells (IgD(-)/CD27(+)). T follicular helper cells 
      (CD4(+)/CXCR5(+)/CD45RA(-)/CCR7(-)) as key components of tertiary lymphoid 
      structures and plasma cells made up high percentages of the lymphocyte infiltrate. 
      Percentages of regulatory B cell varied depending on the regulatory phenotype. 
      Analysis of humoral immune responses against 23 tumor-associated antigens (TAA) 
      showed reactivity against at least one antigen in 56% of HNSCC patients. Reactivity 
      was less frequent in human papillomavirus associated (HPV(+)) patients and healthy 
      controls compared to HPV negative (HPV(-)) HNSCC. Likewise, patients with early 
      stage HNSCC or MHC-I loss on tumor cells had low TAA responses. Patients with TAA 
      responses showed CD4(+) dominated T cell infiltration compared to mainly CD8(+) T 
      cells in tumors without detected TAA response. To summarize, our data demonstrates 
      different immune infiltration patterns in relation to serological TAA response 
      detection and the presence of B cell subpopulations in HNSCC that can engage in 
      tumor promoting and antitumor activity. In view of increasing use of 
      immunotherapeutic approaches, it will be important to include B cells into 
      comprehensive phenotypic and functional analyses of tumor-associated lymphocytes.

AB  - Since 2006, meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) conjugate (MCC) vaccines have been 
      supplied by the Brazilian government for HIV-infected children under 13 years old. 
      For measuring protection against MenC, the serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) assay 
      is the method of choice. The characterization of T follicular helper cells (TFH) 
      cells has been an area of intensive study because of their significance in multiple 
      human diseases and in vaccinology. The objective of this study was to characterize 
      the phenotype of peripheral TFH cells and B cells and how they associated with each 
      other and with SBA levels induced by vaccination as well as with serum cytokine 
      levels of HIV-infected and non-infected children and adolescents. We found that 
      CD27(-)IgD(-)CD21(-)CD38(+) (exhausted B cells) as well as short-lived plasmablasts 
      (CD27(+)IgD(-)CD21(-)CD38(+)) are increased in cART treated HIV patients and 
      negatively associated with MCC vaccine induced SBA levels. Baseline frequency of 
      activated peripheral TFH cells was a negative correlate for SBA response to MCC 
      vaccine but positively correlated with circulating plasmablast frequency. Baseline 
      IL4-levels positively associated with SBA response but showed a negative correlation 
      with activated peripheral TFH cells frequency. The increased frequency of activated 
      peripheral TFH cells found in non-responders to the vaccine implies that higher 
      activation/differentiation of CD4 T cells within the lymph node is not necessarily 
      associated with induction of vaccine responses.

AB  - Spontaneous or treatment induced seroconversion in chronic HBV infection is rare and 
      generation of anti-HBs antibodies is the current goal of HBV therapeutics. Here we 
      investigated B and follicular T helper (Tfh) cell defects that persist in HBV 
      infection despite long-term nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) treatment and possible 
      mechanisms behind them. RNA sequencing revealed that patient B cells have 
      upregulated expression of multiple inhibitory receptors including members of FcRL 
      family and downregulation of genes involved in antigen presentation. An expansion of 
      atypical memory CD19(+)CD10(-)CD27(-)CD21(-) subset of B cells, that express high 
      levels of FcRL5, is persistently present in patients. HBs antigen specific IgG 
      response is concentrated in classical memory and not in atypical memory subset, 
      confirming dysfunction of this subset. Activated Tfh, which expressed excessive 
      CD40L upon polyclonal stimulation, were present in patients. Incubation of B cells 
      from healthy individuals with HBV core (HBc) or CD40L resulted in induction of 
      inhibitory receptors FcRL4, FcRL5 and PD-1 on CD19+ cells and resulted in altered B 
      cell phenotypes. Mechanistically, HBc binds B cells and causes proliferation 
      specifically of FcRL5+ B cell subset. Our results provide evidence that HBV directly 
      causes upregulation of inhibitory pathways in B cells resulting in an accumulation 
      of atypical B cells that lack anti-HBs function.

AB  - Activated PI3K-delta syndrome (APDS) is an immunodeficiency caused by 
      gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CD. This disease exhibits complex immune 
      phenotypes including increased IgM, recurrent infection, and impaired vaccine 
      responses. To better understand the impact of B cells in this disease, we generated 
      an inducible model of the common APDS mutation (hPIK3CD-E1021K; referred to as 
      aPIK3CD) and intercrossed these mice with B cell-specific Cre models. Mb1-aPIK3CD 
      mice exhibited bone marrow B lymphopenia and, conversely, expansion of the 
      peripheral innate B1a and MZ B cell compartments. aPIK3CD B cells manifest increased 
      pS6 and increased survival at several stages, without alterations in cycling, and 
      baseline increases in plasma cells, natural IgM, and IgG3. Finally, Mb1-aPIK3CD mice 
      exhibited blunted T cell-independent immune responses, and both AID- and 
      CD21-aPIK3CD mice displayed reduced class-switched antibodies following T 
      cell-dependent immunization. Thus, aPIK3CD alters B cell development and function 
      and is counter-productive during immune responses, providing insight into B 
      cell-intrinsic contributions to the APDS phenotype.

AB  - B cells are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the ongoing 
      control of hepatitis B virus (HBV). The development of antibodies against the viral 
      surface antigen (HBV surface antigen [HBsAgs]) constitutes the hallmark of 
      resolution of acute infection and is a therapeutic goal for functional cure of 
      chronic HBV (CHB). We characterized B cells directly ex vivo from the blood and 
      liver of patients with CHB to investigate constraints on their antiviral potential. 
      Unexpectedly, we found that HBsAg-specific B cells persisted in the blood and liver 
      of many patients with CHB and were enriched for T-bet, a signature of antiviral 
      potential in B cells. However, purified, differentiated HBsAg-specific B cells from 
      patients with CHB had defective antibody production, consistent with undetectable 
      anti-HBs antibodies in vivo. HBsAg-specific and global B cells had an accumulation 
      of CD21-CD27- atypical memory B cells (atMBC) with high expression of inhibitory 
      receptors, including PD-1. These atMBC demonstrated altered signaling, homing, 
      differentiation into antibody-producing cells, survival, and 
      antiviral/proinflammatory cytokine production that could be partially rescued by 
      PD-1 blockade. Analysis of B cells within healthy and HBV-infected livers implicated 
      the combination of this tolerogenic niche and HBV infection in driving PD-1hiatMBC 
      and impairing B cell immunity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a well-known primary immunodeficiency with 
      recurrent sinopulmonary infections and variable abnormalities in both the humoral 
      and cellular immune system. Dysfunctions in immunoglobulin production, reduced 
      number of B cells, and B-cell receptor excision circles copies have been reported. 
      We aimed to understand the immunological mechanisms involving the humoral 
      compartment in AT patients by analysing peripheral blood B cells subsets, B-T 
      lymphocyte cooperation through the expression of CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L), and 
      cytokines involved in class-switch recombination production. METHODS: We compared 
      the proportion of B-cell subsets, the expression of CD40/CD40L, and the plasma 
      levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ of 18 AT patients and 15 healthy age-sex-matched controls 
      using flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that some steps in peripheral B cell 
      development were altered in AT with a pronounced reduction of cell-surface CD40 
      expression. The proportions of transitional and naïve-mature B cells were reduced, 
      whereas CD21-low, natural effector memory, IgM-only memory, and IgG atypical memory 
      B cells were present in a higher proportion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed a 
      disturbed B-cell homeostasis with unconventional maturation of B lymphocyte memory 
      cells, which can explain the consequent impairment of humoral immunity.

AB  - Individuals over the age of 65 comprise a substantial portion of the world 
      population and become more susceptible to vaccine-preventable infections with age as 
      vaccination response diminishes. The underlying reason for this impaired vaccine 
      response in older individuals is not entirely clear. We evaluated potential 
      differences in phenotypic and functional responses of B cells from healthy younger 
      (22-45years) and older (64-95years) individuals that may associate with a diminished 
      antibody response to influenza vaccination. We report that age is associated with 
      expansion of atypical memory B cells (CD10(-)CD20(+)CD21(-)CD27(-)) and an 
      age-associated B cell (ABC, CD21(-)T-bet(+)CD11c(+)) phenotype. Reduced expression 
      of PAX5 was also seen in older individuals. Poor influenza-specific antibody 
      production following vaccination was associated with low PAX5 expression and a 
      distinct composition of the ABC compartment. Collectively, these findings 
      demonstrate that the characteristics of the ABC populations of older individuals are 
      associated with antibody production following influenza vaccination.

AB  - Despite the long-standing recognition that the immune response to acute myocardial 
      injury contributes to adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling, it has not been 
      possible to effectively target this clinically. Using 2 different in vivo models of 
      acute myocardial injury, we show that pirfenidone confers beneficial effects in the 
      murine heart through an unexpected mechanism that depends on cardiac B lymphocytes. 
      Naive hearts contained a large population of CD19+CD11b-CD23-CD21-IgD+IgMlo 
      lymphocytes, and 2 smaller populations of CD19+CD11b+ B1a and B1b cells. In response 
      to tissue injury, there was an increase in neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, as 
      well as an increase in CD19+ CD11b- B lymphocytes. Treatment with pirfenidone had no 
      effect on the number of neutrophils, monocytes, or macrophages, but decreased 
      CD19+CD11b- lymphocytes. B cell depletion abrogated the beneficial effects of 
      pirfenidone. In vitro studies demonstrated that stimulation with lipopolysaccharide 
      and extracts from necrotic cells activated CD19+ lymphocytes through a 
      TIRAP-dependent pathway. Treatment with pirfenidone attenuated this activation of B 
      cells. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated complexity of myocardial B 
      lymphocytes within the inflammatory infiltrate triggered by cardiac injury and 
      suggest that pirfenidone exerts beneficial effects in the heart through a unique 
      mechanism that involves modulation of cardiac B lymphocytes.

TI  - Ovine Leukocyte Microparticles Generated by the CentriMag Ventricular Assist Device 
      In Vitro.
PG  - E78-E89
LID - 10.1111/aor.13068 [doi]
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are a life-saving form of mechanical circulatory 
      support in heart failure patients. However, VADs have not yet reached their full 
      potential due to the associated side effects (thrombosis, bleeding, infection) 
      related to the activation and damage of blood cells and proteins caused by 
      mechanical stress and foreign materials. Studies of the effects of VADs on 
      leukocytes are limited, yet leukocyte activation and damage including microparticle 
      generation can influence both thrombosis and infection rates. Therefore, the aim was 
      to develop a multicolor flow cytometry assessment of leukocyte microparticles (LMPs) 
      using ovine blood and the CentriMag VAD as a model for shear stress. Ovine blood was 
      pumped for 6 h in the CentriMag and regular samples analyzed for hemolysis, complete 
      blood counts and LMP by flow cytometry during three different pump operating 
      conditions (low flow, standard, high speed). The high speed condition caused 
      significant increases in plasma-free hemoglobin; decreases in total leukocytes, 
      granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets; increases in CD45(+) LMPs as well as two 
      novel LMP populations: CD11b(bright) /HLA-DR(-) and CD11b(dull) /HLA-DR(+) , both of 
      which were CD14(-) /CD21(-) . CD11b(bright) /HLA-DR(-) LMPs appeared to respond to 
      an increase in shear magnitude whereas the CD11b(dull) /HLA-DR(+) LMPs significantly 
      increased in all pumping conditions. We propose that these two populations are 
      released from granulocytes and T cells, respectively, but further research is needed 
      to better characterize these two populations.

AB  - Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive malignant disease 
      that is associated with Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection. To date, the mechanism 
      of viral entry into NK cells remains uncertain. Here, we investigated this mechanism 
      using human NK cells in vitro. CD21 mRNA expression, an EBV-entry receptor, was 
      transiently detected in NK cells after exosome treatment, and levels decreased after 
      further culture. CD21 protein expression was also transiently transferred to NK 
      cells after co-culture with an EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Raji) via 
      trogocytosis. However, EBV did not infect NK cells through CD21-mediated 
      trogocytosis. Unexpectedly, when NK cell leukemia cells, as well as primary NK 
      cells, were treated with viral supernatant, EBV genes, but not RNA, were detected in 
      the NK cells, at latency stage 0. Therefore, these results suggest that EBV-NK cell 
      infection results from the direct transfer of viral episomes, independent of 
      EBV-positive B cells.

TI  - Comparison of Phenotypic and Functional Characteristics Between Canine Non-B, Non-T

      Lymphocytes.
PG  - 841

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells play a pivotal role in the immune response against 
      infections and malignant transformation, and adopted transfer of NK cells is thought 
      to be a promising therapeutic approach for cancer patients. Previous reports 
      describing the phenotypic features of canine NK cells have produced inconsistent 
      results. Canine NK cells are still defined as non-B and non-T (CD3(-)CD21(-)) large 
      granular lymphocytes. However, a few reports have demonstrated that canine NK cells 
      share the phenotypic characteristics of T lymphocytes, and that 
      CD3(+)CD5(dim)CD21(-) lymphocytes are putative canine NK cells. Based on our 
      previous reports, we hypothesized that phenotypic modulation could occur between 
      these two populations during activation. In this study, we investigated the 
      phenotypic and functional differences between CD3(+)CD5(dim)CD21(-) (cytotoxic large 
      granular lymphocytes) and CD3(-)CD5(-)CD21(-) NK lymphocytes before and after 
      culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from normal dogs. The results 
      of this study show that CD3(+)CD5(dim)CD21(-) lymphocytes can be differentiated into 
      non-B, non-T NK (CD3(-)CD5(-)CD21(-)TCRαβ(-)TCRγδ(-)GranzymeB(+)) lymphocytes 
      through phenotypic modulation in response to cytokine stimulation. In vitro studies 
      of purified CD3(+)CD5(dim)CD21(-) cells showed that CD3(-)CD5(-)CD21(-) cells are 
      derived from CD3(+)CD5(dim)CD21(-) cells through phenotypic modulation. 
      CD3(+)CD5(dim)CD21(-) cells share more NK cell functional characteristics compared 
      with CD3(-)CD5(-)CD21(-) cells, including the expression of T-box transcription 
      factors (Eomes, T-bet), the production of granzyme B and interferon-γ, and the 
      expression of NK cell-related molecular receptors such as NKG2D and NKp30. In 
      conclusion, the results of this study suggest that CD3(+)CD5(dim)CD21(-) and 
      CD3(-)CD5(-)CD21(-) cells both contain a subset of putative NK cells, and the 
      difference between the two populations may be due to the degree of maturation.

TI  - Activating natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity of canine CD5(-)CD21(-) cells requires 
      low surface CD5 density NK cells.
PG  - 87-95
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in regulating immune functions. Few 
      studies have characterized canine NK cells. We previously demonstrated that canine 
      peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with a low surface CD5 density (CD5lo) are 
      considered a critical NK population. Natural killer cells in most mammals do not 
      express T-cell markers, but canine CD5lo cells express surface molecules, such as 
      CD3 T-cell receptors. These features make canines unique models for the study of 
      comparative immunology in NK cells. In this study, we discovered that CD5lo and CD21 
      double-negative (CD5lo-ne/CD2(-)) cells were originally low in NK cytotoxicity and 
      their NK cytotoxicity was highly activated when co-cultured with CD5lo NK cells. The 
      cytotoxicity was not activated when co-cultured with other cell types, such as high 
      surface CD5 density (CD5hi) cells. The CD5lo-negative (CD5lo-ne) population 
      comprises CD5(-) and CD5hi cells. CD5-cells were low in NK cytotoxicity initially or 
      after culturing with interleukin-2 (IL-2) without CD5lo cells; however, the addition 
      of CD5lo cells in a similar medium markedly enhanced the NK activity. By contrast, 
      CD5hi cells were always NK inactive, irrespective of them being cultured with CD5lo 
      cells or not. We further verified that only the CD5(-)CD21(-) cells, which were 
      separated from CD5(-)CD21(+) cells in the entire CD5(-) population, showed activated 
      NK activity through CD5lo cell induction. This study is the first to reveal that 
      canine NK cells enhanced NK-inert cells to become NK-cytotoxic cells. Additionally, 
      it is concluded that in beagles, except for CD5lo cells, CD5(-)CD21(-) cells show NK 
      activity.

TI  - Age-associated B cells expanded in autoimmune mice are memory cells sharing 
      H-CDR3-selected repertoires.
PG  - 509-521
LID - 10.1002/eji.201747127 [doi]
AB  - Age-associated B cells (ABCs) represent a distinct cell population expressing low 
      levels of CD21 (CD21(-/low) ). The Ig repertoire expressed by ABCs in aged mice is 
      diverse and exhibits signs of somatic hypermutation (SHM). A CD21(-/low) B-cell 
      population is expanded in autoimmune diseases, e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, as 
      well as in lupus-prone NZB/W mice and in mice lacking a pre-B cell receptor 
      (SLC(-/-) ). However, the nature of the CD21(-/low) B cells (hereafter ABCs) in 
      autoimmunity is not well understood. Here we show that in young SLC(-/-) mice, the 
      vast majority of the ABCs express memory B-cell (MBC) markers in contrast to 
      wild-type controls. A similar population is present in lupus-prone MRL mice before 
      and at disease onset. In SLC(-/-) mice, a majority of the ABCs are IgM(+) , their 
      V(H) genes have undergone SHM, show clonal diversification and clonal restriction at 
      the H-CDR3 level. ABC hybridomas, established from SLC(-/-) mice, secrete typical 
      lupus autoantibodies, e.g. anti-Smith antigen, and some of those that bind to DNA 
      comprise a H-CDR3 that is identical to previously described IgM anti-DNA antibodies 
      from lupus-prone mice. Together, these results reveal that ABCs in autoimmune mice 
      are comprised of autoreactive MBCs expressing highly restricted H-CDR3 repertoires.

TI  - Accumulation of Antigen-Driven Lymphoproliferations in Complement Receptor 
      2/CD21(-/low) B Cells From Patients With Sjögren's Syndrome.
PG  - 298-307
LID - 10.1002/art.40352 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS) are prone to develop malignant 
      lymphomas, and a correlation has been established between the lymphoproliferations 
      occurring in these disorders and the presence in patients' blood of an unusual B 
      cell population that down-regulates complement receptor 2/CD21. This study was 
      undertaken to identify the B cell compartment from which these lymphoproliferations 
      emerge and determine the mechanisms that promote clonal B cell expansion in patients 
      with SS. METHODS: The reactivity of antibodies expressed by 
      CD19+CD10-CD27-IgM+CD21(-/low) cells isolated from the blood of patients with SS was 
      tested using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach that allows us to clone and 
      express, in vitro, recombinant antibodies produced by single B cells. RESULTS: 
      Clonal expansions were identified in CD21(-/low) B cells isolated from the 
      peripheral blood of 3 patients with SS. These lymphoproliferations expressed B cell 
      receptors (BCRs) that displayed somatic hypermutation lineage trees characteristic 
      of a strong selection by antigens; one of these antigens was identified as a 
      ribosomal self antigen. When the mutated BCR sequences expressed by the expanded 
      CD21(-/low) B cell clones from patients with SS were reverted in vitro to their 
      germline counterparts, one clone remained autoreactive. CONCLUSION: Clonal 
      lymphoproliferations in patients with SS preferentially accumulate in the 
      autoreactive CD21(-/low) B cell compartment often expanded in these subjects, and 
      recognition of self antigens may drive the clonal B cell expansion while further 
      refining BCR self-reactivity.

AB  - Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) remains a major complication of allogeneic 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A number of studies support a role 
      for B cells in the pathogenesis of cGvHD. In this study, we report the presence of 
      an expanded population of CD19+CD21- B cells with features of exhaustion in the 
      peripheral blood of patients with cGvHD. CD21- B cells were significantly increased 
      in patients with active cGvHD compared to patients without cGvHD and healthy 
      controls (median 12.2 versus 2.12 versus 3%, respectively; p < 0.01). Compared with 
      naïve (CD27-CD21+) and classical memory (CD27+CD21+) B cells, CD19+CD21- B cells in 
      cGvHD were CD10 negative, CD27 negative and CD20hi, and exhibited features of 
      exhaustion, including increased expression of multiple inhibitory receptors such as 
      FCRL4, CD22, CD85J, and altered expression of chemokine and adhesion molecules such 
      as CD11c, CXCR3, CCR7, and CD62L. Moreover, CD21- B cells in cGvHD patients were 
      functionally exhausted and displayed poor proliferative response and calcium 
      mobilization in response to B-cell receptor triggering and CD40 ligation. Finally, 
      the frequencies of circulating CD21- B cells correlated with cGvHD severity in 
      patients after HSCT. Our study further characterizes B cells in chronic cGVHD and 
      supports the use of CD21-CD27-CD10- B cell frequencies as a biomarker of disease 
      severity.

TI  - Using a Commonly Down-Regulated Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Promoter for High-Level 
      Expression of Ectopic Gene in a Human B Lymphoma Cell Line.
PG  - 5943-5950
AB  - BACKGROUND Vectors are widely used to drive gene expression using a promoter. 
      However, not all promoters are able to drive ectopic gene expression efficiently, 
      including CMV promoter. Here, we report our data using CMV promoter for high-level 
      gene expression in a B lymphoma cell line DG75. MATERIAL AND METHODS A plasmid 
      (pcDNA3.1(+)) containing the CD21 gene driven under CMV promoter was constructed. 
      The plasmid was stably transfected into a human B lymphoma cell line DG75 for 
      cellular surface CD21 expression, and flow cytometry was used to monitor CD21 
      expression. CD21+ cells in the stable cell line were purified using anti-CD21 
      antibody-coupled Dynabeads for CD21-mediated antigen presentation experiment. 
      RESULTS The percentage of CD21+ cells in newly generated stable 
      DG75-pcDNA3.1(+)-CD21 cells was only 6.5% as determined by flow cytometry, which was 
      unexpected and did not fit the requirements for further experiments. However, CD21+ 
      cells could be purified to 100% using anti-CD21 antibody-coupled beads. The 
      percentage of CD21+ cells in purified cells can be kept at 95%, 82%, 42%, 15%, and 
      42% at 7 d, 14 d, 34 d, and 42 d after purification, respectively. Specific T cell 
      response against CD21-mediated antigen presentation can be activated successfully 
      only when surface CD21 expression remains high. CONCLUSIONS A commonly 
      down-regulated CMV promoter can be used to drive ectopic gene expression at a 
      high-level in stable cell lines. Our results should facilitate future experimental 
      design using other down-regulated promoters containing vectors such as SV40 and 
      PGK1.

TI  - Relative Impact of Complement Receptors CD21/35 (Cr2/1) on Scrapie Pathogenesis in 
      Mice.
LID - 10.1128/mSphereDirect.00493-17 [doi]
LID - e00493-17
AB  - Complement receptors 1 and 2 (CR1/2 or CD35/CD21) recognize complement-opsonized 
      antigens to initiate innate and adaptive immunity, respectively. CD35 stimulates 
      phagocytosis on macrophages and antigen presentation on follicular dendritic cells 
      (FDCs). CD21 helps activate B cells as part of the B cell coreceptor with CD19 and 
      CD81. Differential splicing of transcripts from the mouse Cr2 gene generates 
      isoforms with both shared and unique complement binding capacities and cell-type 
      expression. In mouse models, genetic depletion of Cr2 causes either a delay or 
      complete prevention of prion disease, but the relative importance of CD35 versus 
      CD21 in promoting prion disease remains unknown. Here we show that both isoforms act 
      as high-affinity cell surface prion receptors. However, mice lacking CD21 succumbed 
      to terminal prion disease significantly later than mice lacking CD35 or wild-type 
      and hemizygous mice. CD21-deficient mice contained fewer splenic prions than CD35 
      knockout mice early after infection that contributed to delayed prion neuroinvasion 
      and terminal disease, despite forming follicular networks closer to proximal nerves. 
      While we observed no difference in B cell networks, PrP(C) expression, or number of 
      follicles, CD21-deficient mice formed more fragmented, less organized follicular 
      networks with fewer Mfge8-positive FDCs and/or tingible body macrophages (TBMφs) 
      than wild-type or CD35-deficient mice. In toto, these data demonstrate a more 
      prominent role for CD21 for proper follicular development and organization leading 
      to more efficient lymphoid prion replication and expedited prion disease than in 
      mice expressing the CD35 isoform. IMPORTANCE Mammalian prion diseases are caused by 
      prions, unique infectious agents composed primarily, if not solely, of a pathologic, 
      misfolded form of a normal host protein, the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). Prions 
      replicate without a genetic blueprint, but rather contact PrP(C) and coerce it to 
      misfold into more prions, which cause neurodegeneration akin to other 
      protein-misfolding diseases like Alzheimer's disease. A single gene produces two 
      alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts that encode mouse complement receptors 
      CD21/35, which promote efficient prion replication in the lymphoid system and 
      eventual movement to the brain. Here we show that CD21/35 are high-affinity prion 
      receptors, but mice expressing only CD21 die from prion disease sooner than 
      CD35-expressing mice, which contain less prions early after infection and exhibit 
      delayed terminal disease, likely due to their less organized splenic follicles. 
      Thus, CD21 appears to be more important for defining splenic architecture that 
      influences prion pathogenesis.

      tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs); however, tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) have 
      also been reported to correlate with NSCLC patient survival. The function of TIL-Bs 
      in human cancer has been understudied, with little focus on their role as 
      antigen-presenting cells and their influence on CD4(+) TILs. Compared with other 
      immune subsets detected in freshly isolated primary tumors from NSCLC patients, we 
      observed increased numbers of intratumoral B cells relative to B cells from 
      tumor-adjacent tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TIL-Bs can efficiently 
      present antigen to CD4(+) TILs and alter the CD4(+) TIL phenotype using an in vitro 
      antigen-presentation assay. Specifically, we identified three CD4(+) TIL responses 
      to TIL-Bs, which we categorized as activated, antigen-associated, and nonresponsive. 
      Within the activated and antigen-associated CD4(+) TIL population, activated TIL-Bs 
      (CD19(+)CD20(+)CD69(+)CD27(+)CD21(+)) were associated with an effector T-cell 
      response (IFNγ(+) CD4(+) TILs). Alternatively, exhausted TIL-Bs 
      (CD19(+)CD20(+)CD69(+)CD27(-)CD21(-)) were associated with a regulatory T-cell 
      phenotype (FoxP3(+) CD4(+) TILs). Our results demonstrate a new role for TIL-Bs in 
      NSCLC tumors in their interplay with CD4(+) TILs in the tumor microenvironment, 
      establishing them as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC immunotherapy. Cancer

AB  - Many chronic infections, including malaria and HIV, are associated with a large 
      expansion of CD21-CD27- 'atypical' memory B cells (MBCs) that exhibit reduced B cell 
      receptor (BCR) signaling and effector functions. Little is known about the 
      conditions or transcriptional regulators driving atypical MBC differentiation. Here 
      we show that atypical MBCs in malaria-exposed individuals highly express the 
      transcription factor T-bet, and that T-bet expression correlates inversely with BCR 
      signaling and skews toward IgG3 class switching. Moreover, a longitudinal analysis 
      of a subset of children suggested a correlation between the incidence of febrile 
      malaria and the expansion of T-bethi B cells. The Th1-cytokine containing 
      supernatants of malaria-stimulated PBMCs plus BCR cross linking induced T-bet 
      expression in naïve B cells that was abrogated by neutralizing IFN-γ or blocking the 
      IFN-γ receptor on B cells. Accordingly, recombinant IFN-γ plus BCR cross-linking 
      drove T-bet expression in peripheral and tonsillar B cells. Consistent with this, 
      Th1-polarized Tfh (Tfh-1) cells more efficiently induced T-bet expression in naïve B 
      cells. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying atypical MBC 
      differentiation.

TI  - Perturbation of B Cell Gene Expression Persists in HIV-Infected Children Despite 
      Effective Antiretroviral Therapy and Predicts H1N1 Response.

AB  - Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected individuals with 
      apparently similar clinical and immunological characteristics can vary in 
      responsiveness to vaccinations. However, molecular mechanisms responsible for such 
      impairment, as well as biomarkers able to predict vaccine responsiveness in 
      HIV-infected children, remain unknown. Following the hypothesis that a B cell 
      qualitative impairment persists in HIV-infected children (HIV) despite effective ART 
      and phenotypic B cell immune reconstitution, the aim of the current study was to 
      investigate B cell gene expression of HIV compared to age-matched healthy controls 
      (HCs) and to determine whether distinct gene expression patterns could predict the 
      ability to respond to influenza vaccine. To do so, we analyzed prevaccination 
      transcriptional levels of a 96-gene panel in equal numbers of sort-purified B cell 
      subsets (SPBS) isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiplexed 
      RT-PCR. Immune responses to H1N1 antigen were determined by hemaglutination 
      inhibition and memory B cell ELISpot assays following trivalent-inactivated 
      influenza vaccination (TIV) for all study participants. Although there were no 
      differences in terms of cell frequencies of SPBS between HIV and HC, the groups were 
      distinguishable based upon gene expression analyses. Indeed, a 28-gene signature, 
      characterized by higher expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response 
      and immune activation was observed in activated memory B cells (CD27(+)CD21(-)) from 
      HIV when compared to HC despite long-term viral control (>24 months). Further 
      analysis, taking into account H1N1 responses after TIV in HIV participants, revealed 
      that a 25-gene signature in resting memory (RM) B cells (CD27(+)CD21(+)) was able to 
      distinguish vaccine responders from non-responders (NR). In fact, prevaccination RM 
      B cells of responders showed a higher expression of gene sets involved in B cell 
      adaptive immune responses (APRIL, BTK, BLIMP1) and BCR signaling (MTOR, FYN, CD86) 
      when compared to NR. Overall, these data suggest that a perturbation at a 
      transcriptional level in the B cell compartment persists despite stable virus 
      control achieved through ART in HIV-infected children. Additionally, the present 
      study demonstrates the potential utility of transcriptional evaluation of RM B cells 
      before vaccination for identifying predictive correlates of vaccine responses in 
      this population.

LID - 1044
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLR) triggering of B cells are known to promote B cell 
      expansion, differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing and memory cells, but 
      the TLR responses of porcine B cells is poorly characterized. Therefore, this study 
      investigated the response pattern of porcine B cell subsets to a large collection of 
      TLR ligands and demonstrates that the TLR2 ligand Pam3Cys-SK4 and the TLR7/8 ligands 
      gardiquimod and resiquimod are particularly efficient at inducing proliferation, 
      CD25 and CCR7. This activation was also determined in B-cell subpopulations 
      including a CD21(+)IgM(+) subset, an IgG(+) subset and two putative B1-like subsets, 
      defined as CD21(-)IgM(high)CD11R1(+)CD11c(+)CD14(+) and CD21(-)IgM(high) 
      CD11R1(-)CD11c(+)CD14(-) B cells. The latter two were larger and expressed higher 
      levels of CD80/86 and spontaneous phospholipase C-γ2 phosphorylation. All porcine 
      B-cell subsets were activated by TLR2, TLR7, and TLR9 ligands. Naïve and memory 
      conventional B cells responded similar to TLR ligands. The CD11R1(+) B1-like subset 
      had the highest proliferative responses. While both B1-like subsets did not 
      spontaneously secrete IgM, they were the only subsets to produce high level of 
      TLR-induced IgM. Similar to polyclonal IgM responses, memory B cells were 
      efficiently induced to produce specific antibodies by CpG oligodinucleotide, 
      resiquimod, and to a weaker extend by Pam3Cys-SK4. Depletion of plasmacytoid 
      dendritic cells (pDCs) enhanced TLR-induced antibodies. The same set of TLR ligands 
      also induced CD40 on cDCs, pDCs, and monocytes with the exception of TLR4 ligand 
      being unable to activate pDCs. Gardiquimod and resiquimod were particularly 
      efficient at inducing CCR7 on pDCs. Porcine B cells expressed high levels of TLR7, 
      but relatively little other TLR mRNA. Nevertheless, TLR2 on B cells was rapidly 
      upregulated following stimulation, explaining the strong responses following 
      stimulation. Subset-specific analysis of TLR expression demonstrated a comparable 
      expression of TLR2, TLR7, and TLR9 in all B cell subsets, but TLR3 was restricted to 
      B1-like cells, whereas TLR4 was only expressed on conventional B cells, although 
      both at low levels. Altogether, our data describe porcine innate B1-like cells, and 
      how different B cell subsets are involved in innate sensing.

AB  - Circulating mixed cryoglobulins are detected in 40%-60% of patients with hepatitis C 
      virus (HCV) infection, and overt cryoglobulinemia vasculitis (CryoVas) develops in 
      approximately 15% of patients. Remission of vasculitis has been associated with 
      viral clearance, but few studies have reported the effectiveness of direct-acting 
      antiviral drugs in these patients. We performed an open-label, prospective, 
      multicenter study of the effectiveness and tolerance of an all-oral, interferon- and 
      ribavirin-free regimen of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir in patients with 
      HCV-associated CryoVas. Forty-one consecutive patients with active HCV-associated 
      CryoVas (median age, 56 y; 53.6% women) were recruited from hospitals in Paris, 
      France, from 2014 through 2016. They received sofosbuvir (400 mg/day) plus 
      daclatasvir (60 mg/day) for 12 weeks (n = 32) or 24 weeks (n = 9), and were 
      evaluated every 4 weeks until week 24 and at week 36. Blood samples were analyzed 
      for complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, level of alanine 
      aminotransferase, rheumatoid factor activity, C4 fraction of complement, and 
      cryoglobulin; peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated for flow cytometry 
      analysis. Thirty-seven patients (90.2%) had a complete clinical response (defined by 
      improvement of all the affected organs involved at baseline and no clinical relapse) 
      after a median time of 12 weeks of therapy; all had a sustained virologic response 
      (no detectable serum HCV RNA 12 weeks after the end of antiviral therapy). Patients' 
      mean cryoglobulin level decreased from 0.56 ± 0.18 at baseline to 0.21 ± 0.14 g/L at 
      week 36, and no cryoglobulin was detected in 50% of patients at this time point. 
      After antiviral therapy, patients had increased numbers of T-regulatory cells, 
      IgM+CD21-/low-memory B cells, CD4+CXCR5+ interleukin 21+ cells, and T-helper 17 
      cells, compared with before therapy. After a median follow-up period of 26 months 
      (interquartile range, 20-30 mo), no patients had a serious adverse event or relapse 
      of vasculitis.

TI  - Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy Restores Immune Tolerance to Patients With Hepatitis 
      C Virus-Induced Cryoglobulinemia Vasculitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies are 
      effective in patients with hepatitis C virus-induced cryoglobulinemia vasculitis 
      (HCV-CV). We analyzed blood samples from patients with HCV-CV before and after DAA 
      therapy to determine mechanisms of these drugs and their effects on cellular 
      immunity. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 27 consecutive patients with 
      HCV-CV (median age, 59 y) treated with DAA therapy (21 patients received sofosbuvir 
      plus ribavirin for 24 weeks, 4 patients received sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir for 12 
      weeks, and 2 patients received sofosbuvir plus simeprevir for 12 weeks) in Paris, 
      France. Blood samples were collected from these patients before and after DAA 
      therapy, and also from 12 healthy donors and 12 individuals with HCV infection 
      without CV. HCV load, cryoglobulins, and cytokines were quantified by flow 
      cytometry, cytokine multiplex assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (88.9%) had a complete clinical response of CV to DAA 
      therapy at week 24, defined by improvement of all the affected organs and the 
      absence of relapse. Compared with healthy donors and patients with HCV infection 
      without CV, patients with HCV-CV, before DAA therapy, had a lower percentage of 
      CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+ regulatory T cells (P < .01), but higher proportions 
      of IgM+CD21-/low memory B cells (P < .05), CD4+IFNγ+ cells (P < .01), CD4+IL17A+ 
      cells (P < .01), and CD4+CXCR5+interleukin 21+ follicular T-helper (Tfh) cells (P < 
      .01). In patients with HCV-CV, there was a negative correlation between numbers of 
      IgM+CD21-/low memory B cells and T-regulatory cells (P = .03), and positive 
      correlations with numbers of Tfh cells (P = .03) and serum levels of cryoglobulin 
      (P = .01). DAA therapy increased patients' numbers of T-regulatory cells (1.5% ± 
      0.18% before therapy vs 2.1% ± 0.18% after therapy), decreased percentages of 
      IgM+CD21-/low memory B cells (35.7% ± 6.1% before therapy vs 14.9% ± 3.8% after 
      therapy), and decreased numbers of Tfh cells (12% ± 1.3% before therapy vs 8% ± 0.9% 
      after therapy). Expression levels of B lymphocyte stimulator receptor 3 and 
      programmed cell death 1 on B cells increased in patients with HCV-CV after DAA-based 
      therapy (mean fluorescence units, 37 ± 2.4 before therapy vs 47 ± 2.6 after therapy, 
      P < .01; and 29 ± 7.3 before therapy vs 48 ± 9.3 after therapy, P < .05, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective clinical trial of patients with HCV-CV, 
      DAA-based therapy restored disturbances in peripheral B- and T-cell homeostasis.

TI  - Hepatitis C viraemia reversibly maintains subset of antigen-specific T-bet+ 
      tissue-like memory B cells.
PG  - 389-396
LID - 10.1111/jvh.12659 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic antigen exposure and/or ageing increases the frequency of T-box 
      expressed in T cells (T-bet)-expressing B-lymphocytes in mice. The frequency and 
      significance of B-cell T-bet expression during chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection 
      in human subjects has never been described. METHODS: Healthy controls, cirrhotic and 
      noncirrhotic HCV-infected patients, and non-HCV patients with cirrhosis were 
      recruited. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were phenotyped for expression of 
      T-bet and related markers by flow cytometry. In a subset of patients who underwent 
      antiviral therapy and were cured of HCV infection (sustained virological response), 
      the dynamics of T-bet expression in B cells was monitored. After cure, convalescent 
      B cells were tested for T-bet expression after re-exposure to infected plasma or 
      recombinant HCV proteins. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients including 11 healthy donors, 
      30 hepatitis C-infected individuals (nine with liver cancer, 13 with cirrhosis, 
      eight without cirrhosis) and eight patients with cirrhosis due to non-HCV-related 
      cause were recruited. We found that B cells in patients with chronic HCV exhibited 
      increased frequency of T-bet+ B cells relative to noninfected individuals (median 
      11.5% v. 2.2%, P<.0001) but that there were no significant differences between 
      noncirrhotic, cirrhotic and cancer-bearing infected individuals. T-Bet(+) B cells 
      expressed higher levels of CD95, CXCR3, CD11c, CD267 and FcRL5 compared to T-bet(-) 
      B cells and predominantly exhibit a tissue-like memory CD27(-) CD21(-) phenotype 
      independent of HCV infection. T-bet(+) B cells in HCV-infected patients were more 
      frequently class-switched IgD(-) IgG(+) (40.4% vs. 26.4%, P=.012). Resolution of HCV 
      infection with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy leads to a marked reduction in 
      the frequency of T-bet(+) B cells (median 14.1% pretreatment v. 6.7% end of 
      treatment v. 6.1% SVR12, P≤.01). Re-exposure of convalescent (cured) B cells to 
      viremic plasma and recombinant HCV E2 protein led to re-expression of T-bet. 
      CONCLUSION: Chronic antigenemia in chronic HCV infection induces and maintains an 
      antigen-specific T-bet(+) B cell. These B cells share markers with tissue-like 
      memory B cells. Antigen-driven T-bet expression may be a critical suppressor of 
      B-cell activation in chronic HCV infection.

TI  - MYSM1-dependent checkpoints in B cell lineage differentiation and B cell-mediated 
      immune response.
PG  - 643-654
LID - 10.1189/jlb.1AB0415-177RR [doi]
AB  - MYSM1 is a chromatin-binding histone deubiquitinase. MYSM1 mutations in humans 
      result in lymphopenia whereas loss of Mysm1 in mice causes severe hematopoietic 
      abnormalities, including an early arrest in B cell development. However, it remains 
      unknown whether MYSM1 is required at later checkpoints in B cell development or for 
      B cell-mediated immune responses. We analyzed conditional mouse models 
      Mysm1(fl/fl)Tg.mb1-cre, Mysm1(fl/fl)Tg.CD19-cre, and Mysm1(fl/fl)Tg.CD21-cre with 
      inactivation of Mysm1 at prepro-B, pre-B, and follicular B cell stages of 
      development. We show that loss of Mysm1 at the prepro-B cell stage in 
      Mysm1(fl/fl)Tg.mb1-cre mice results in impaired B cell differentiation, with an 
      ∼2-fold reduction in B cell numbers in the lymphoid organs. Mysm1(fl/fl)Tg.mb1-cre B 
      cells also showed increased expression of activation markers and impaired survival 
      and proliferation. In contrast, Mysm1 was largely dispensable from the pre-B cell 
      stage onward, with Mysm1(fl/fl)Tg.CD19-cre and Mysm1(fl/fl)Tg.CD21-cre mice showing 
      no alterations in B cell numbers and largely normal responses to stimulation. MYSM1, 
      therefore, has an essential role in B cell lineage specification but is dispensable 
      at later stages of development. Importantly, MYSM1 activity at the prepro-B cell 
      stage of development is important for the normal programming of B cell responses to 
      stimulation once they complete their maturation process.

TI  - Vaccination of rhesus macaques with the live-attenuated HSV-1 vaccine VC2 stimulates 
      the proliferation of mucosal T cells and germinal center responses resulting in 
      sustained production of highly neutralizing antibodies.

AB  - We have shown that the live-attenuated HSV-1 VC2 vaccine strain with mutations in 
      glycoprotein K (gK) and the membrane protein UL20 is unable to establish latency in 
      vaccinated animals and produces a robust immune response capable of completely 
      protecting mice against lethal vaginal HSV-1 or HSV-2 infections. To better 
      understand the immune response generated by vaccination with VC2, we tested its 
      ability to elicit immune responses in rhesus macaques. Vaccinated animals showed no 
      signs of disease and developed increasing HSV-1 and HSV-2 reactive IgG(1) after two 
      booster vaccinations, while IgG subtypes IgG(2) and IgG(3) remained at low to 
      undetectable levels. All vaccinated animals produced high levels of cross protective 
      neutralizing antibodies. Flow cytometry analysis of cells isolated from draining 
      lymph nodes showed that VC2 vaccination stimulated significant increases in 
      plasmablast (CD27(high)CD38(high)) and mature memory (CD21(-)IgM(-)) B cells. T cell 
      analysis on cells isolated from draining lymph node biopsies demonstrated a 
      statistically significant increase in proliferating (Ki67(+)) follicular T helper 
      cells and regulatory CXCR5(+) CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells. Analysis of plasma isolated 
      two weeks post vaccination showed significant increases in circulating CXCL13 
      indicating increased germinal center activity. Cells isolated from vaginal biopsy 
      samples collected over the course of the study exhibited vaccination-dependent 
      increases in proliferating (Ki67(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell populations. These 
      results suggest that intramuscular vaccination with the live-attenuated HSV-1 VC2 
      vaccine strain can stimulate robust IgG(1) antibody responses that persist for 
      >250days post vaccination. In addition, vaccination lead to the maturation of B 
      cells into plasmablast and mature memory B cells, the expansion of follicular T 
      helper cells, and affects in the mucosal immune responses. These data suggest that 
      the HSV VC2 vaccine induces potent immune responses that could help define 
      correlates of protection towards developing an efficacious HSV-1/HSV-2 vaccine in 
      humans.

AB  - Aging and certain viral infections can negatively impact humoral responses in 
      humans. To further develop the nonhuman primate (NHP) model for investigating B cell 
      dynamics in human aging and infectious disease, a flow cytometric panel was 
      developed to characterize circulating rhesus B cell subsets. Significant differences 
      between human and macaque B cells included the proportions of cells within IgD+ and 
      switched memory populations and a prominent CD21-CD27+ unswitched memory population 
      detected only in macaques. We then utilized the expanded panel to analyze B cell 
      alterations associated with aging and acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) 
      infection in the NHP model. In the aging study, distinct patterns of B cell subset 
      frequencies were observed for macaques aged one to five years compared to those 
      between ages 5 and 30 years. In the SIV infection study, B cell frequencies and 
      absolute number were dramatically reduced following acute infection, but recovered 
      within four weeks of infection. Thereafter, the frequencies of activated memory B 
      cells progressively increased; these were significantly correlated with the 
      magnitude of SIV-specific IgG responses, and coincided with impaired maturation of 
      anti-SIV antibody avidity, as previously reported for HIV-1 infection. These 
      observations further validate the NHP model for investigation of mechanisms 
      responsible for B cells alterations associated with immunosenescence and infectious 
      disease.

TI  - Age-Associated B Cells with Proinflammatory Characteristics Are Expanded in a 
      Proportion of Multiple Sclerosis Patients.
PG  - 4576-4583
AB  - Immune aging occurs in the elderly and in autoimmune diseases. Recently, 
      IgD(-)CD27(-) (double negative, DN) and CD21(-)CD11c(+) (CD21(low)) B cells were 
      described as age-associated B cells with proinflammatory characteristics. This study 
      investigated the prevalence and functional characteristics of DN and CD21(low) B 
      cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated a 
      higher proportion of MS patients younger than 60 y with peripheral expansions of DN 
      (8/41) and CD21(low) (9/41) B cells compared with age-matched healthy donors (1/33 
      and 2/33, respectively), which indicates an increase in age-associated B cells in MS 
      patients. The majority of DN B cells had an IgG(+) memory phenotype, whereas 
      CD21(low) B cells consisted of a mixed population of CD27(-) naive, CD27(+) memory, 
      IgG(+), and IgM(+) cells. DN B cells showed similar (MS patients) or increased 
      (healthy donors) MHC-II expression as class-switched memory B cells and intermediate 
      costimulatory molecule expression between naive and class-switched memory B cells, 
      indicating their potential to induce (proinflammatory) T cell responses. Further, DN 
      B cells produced proinflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines following ex vivo 
      stimulation. Increased frequencies of DN and CD21(low) B cells were found in the 
      cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients compared with paired peripheral blood. In 
      conclusion, a proportion of MS patients showed increased peripheral expansions of 
      age-associated B cells. DN and CD21(low) B cell frequencies were further increased 
      in MS cerebrospinal fluid. These cells could contribute to inflammation by induction 
      of T cell responses and the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Canines spontaneously develop many cancers similar to humans - including 
      osteosarcoma, leukemia, and lymphoma - offering the opportunity to study immune 
      therapies in a genetically heterogeneous and immunocompetent environment. However, a 
      lack of antibodies recognizing canine NK cell markers has resulted in suboptimal 
      characterization and unknown purity of NK cell products, hindering the development 
      of canine models of NK cell adoptive immunotherapy. To this end, we generated a 
      novel antibody to canine NCR1 (NKp46), the putative species-wide marker of NK cells, 
      enabling purification of NK cells for further characterization. We demonstrate that 
      CD3(-)/NKp46(+) cells in healthy and osteosarcoma-bearing canines have phenotypic 
      similarity to human CD3(-)/NKp46(+) NK cells, expressing mRNA for CD16 and the 
      natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44, and NKp80. Functionally, we demonstrate 
      with the calcein release assay that canine CD3(-)/NKp46(+) cells kill canine tumor 
      cell lines without prior sensitization and secrete IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-10, and 
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as measured by Luminex. Similar to 
      human NK cells, CD3(-)/NKp46(+) cells expand rapidly on feeder cells expressing 
      4-1BBL and membrane-bound IL-21 (median = 20,283-fold in 21 days). Furthermore, we 
      identify a minor Null population (CD3(-)/CD21(-)/CD14(-)/NKp46(-)) with reduced 
      cytotoxicity against osteosarcoma cells, but similar cytokine secretion as 
      CD3(-)/NKp46(+) cells. Null cells in canines and humans have reduced expression of 
      NKG2D, NKp44, and CD16 compared to NKp46(+) NK cells and can be induced to express 
      NKp46 with further expansion on feeder cells. In conclusion, we have identified and 
      characterized canine NK cells, including an NKp46(-) subset of canine and human NK 
      cells, using a novel anti-canine NKp46 antibody, and report robust ex vivo expansion 
      of canine NK cells sufficient for adoptive immunotherapy.

TI  - Expression of HIV-1 matrix protein p17 and association with B-cell lymphoma in HIV-1 
      transgenic mice.
PG  - 13168-13173
AB  - HIV-1 infection is associated with increased risk for B-cell lymphomas. How HIV 
      infection promotes the development of lymphoma is unclear, but it may involve 
      chronic B-cell activation, inflammation, and/or impaired immunity, possibly leading 
      to a loss of control of oncogenic viruses and reduced tumor immunosurveillance. We 
      hypothesized that HIV structural proteins may contribute to lymphomagenesis 
      directly, because they can persist long term in lymph nodes in the absence of viral 
      replication. The HIV-1 transgenic mouse Tg26 carries a noninfectious HIV-1 provirus 
      lacking part of the gag-pol region, thus constituting a model for studying the 
      effects of viral products in pathogenesis. Approximately 15% of Tg26 mice 
      spontaneously develop leukemia/lymphoma. We investigated which viral proteins are 
      associated with the development of leukemia/lymphoma in the Tg26 mouse model, and 
      performed microarray analysis on RNA from spleen and lymph nodes to identify 
      potential mechanisms of lymphomagenesis. Of the viral proteins examined, only 
      expression of HIV-1 matrix protein p17 was associated with leukemia/lymphoma 
      development and was highly expressed in bone marrow before disease. The tumor cells 
      resembled pro-B cells, and were 
      CD19(+)IgM(-)IgD(-)CD93(+)CD43(+)CD21(-)CD23(-)VpreB(+)CXCR4(+) Consistent with the 
      pro-B-cell stage of B-cell development, microarray analysis revealed enrichment of 
      transcripts, including Rag1, Rag2, CD93, Vpreb1, Vpreb3, and Igll1 We confirmed RAG1 
      expression in Tg26 tumors, and hypothesized that HIV-1 matrix protein p17 may 
      directly induce RAG1 in B cells. Stimulation of human activated B cells with p17 
      enhanced RAG1 expression in three of seven donors, suggesting that intracellular 
      signaling by p17 may lead to genomic instability and transformation.

AB  - Affinity-mature B cells require cognate antigen, retained by follicular dendritic 
      cells (FDCs), for clonal selection within germinal centers. Studies on how FDCs in 
      lymphoid tissues acquire antigen have relied primarily on model protein antigens. To 
      examine delivery of intact bacteria to FDCs, we used inactivated Streptococcus 
      pneumonia (SP). We found that both medullary macrophages and a subset of 
      SIGN-R1-positive dendritic cells (DCs) in the lymph node capture SP from the 
      draining afferent lymphatics. The presence of DCs is required for initial complement 
      activation, opsonization of the bacteria, and efficient transport of SP to FDCs. 
      Moreover, we observed a major role for transport of bacteria to FDCs by naive B 
      cells via a CD21-dependent pathway. We propose a mechanism by which efficient 
      transport of SP to FDCs is dependent on DCs for initial binding and activation of 
      complement and either direct transport to FDCs or transfer to naive B cells.

TI  - CD21(-/low) B cells in human blood are memory cells.
PG  - 252-62
LID - 10.1111/cei.12795 [doi]
AB  - The complement receptor 2 (CR2, CD21) is part of a complex (CD21/CD19/CD81) acting 
      as a co-receptor to the B cell receptor (BCR). Simultaneous triggering of the BCR 
      and CD21 lowers the threshold for B cell activation. Although CD21 is important, B 
      cells that express low amounts or lack surface CD21 (CD21(-/low) ) are increased in 
      conditions with chronic inflammation, e.g. autoimmune diseases. However, little is 
      known about the CD21(-/low) B cell subset in peripheral blood from healthy donors. 
      Here, we show that CD21(-/low) cells represent approximately 5% of B cells in 
      peripheral blood from adults but are barely detectable in cord blood, after 
      excluding transitional B cells. The CD21(-/low) subset can be divided into CD38(-) 
      24(+) and CD38(-) 24(low) cells, where most of the CD38(-) 24(+) are CD27(+) 
      immunoglobulin (Ig)M(+) IgD(+) and the CD38(-) 24(low) are switched CD27(-) . 
      Expression levels of additional markers, e.g. CD95 and CD62L, are similar to those 
      on classical memory B cells. In contrast to naive cells, the majority of CD21(-/low) 
      cells lack expression of the ABCB1 transporter. Stimulation with a combination of 
      BCR, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7/8 and interleukin (IL)-2 induces proliferation and 
      differentiation of the CD21(-/low) B cells comparable to CD21(+) CD27(+) memory B 
      cells. The response excluding BCR agonist is not on par with that of classical 
      memory B cells, although clearly above that of naive B cells. This is ascribed to a 
      weaker response by the CD38(-) 24(low) subset, implying that some memory B cells 
      require not only TLR but also BCR triggering. We conclude that the CD21(-/low) cells 
      in healthy donors are memory B cells.

AB  - IL-10 secreting CD21(+) B cells exist in sheep Peyer's patches (PP). It's not known 
      however, whether all PP B cells are regulatory or whether an effector population 
      also exists in this tissue. To further characterize the subpopulations of B cells in 
      PP's, highly purified B cells were negatively sorted from jejunal PP and 
      fractionated according to co-expression of CD72(+)CD21(+)or CD72(+)CD21(-) molecules 
      and then stimulated with the TLR9-agonist, CpG ODN. IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ, and IgM 
      production were then assayed. We observed that only highly purified CD72(+)CD21(+) B 
      cells spontaneously secreted high levels of IL-10, but they did not produce any 
      IL-12, IFN-γ or IgM suggesting that this cell population contains regulatory B 
      cells. In contrast, CD72(+)CD21(-) B cells did not secrete IL-10, but secreted 
      IL-12, IFN-γ, and IgM, suggesting they include effector cells. In addition, B cells 
      expressing surface IgA, IgM and IgG1 all secreted similar levels of IL-10. We 
      further confirmed that only B cells produce IL-10, while other cells in the PP 
      including DCs and T cells do not. Our investigations may provide evidence for the 
      existence of two sub-populations in sheep PP; IL-10 secreting regulatory 
      (CD72(+)CD21(+)) cells, and IL-12/IFN-γ/IgM-secreting effector (CD72(+)CD21(-)) 
      cells.

TI  - A distinct plasmablast and naïve B-cell phenotype in primary immune 
      thrombocytopenia.
PG  - 698-706
LID - 10.3324/haematol.2015.137273 [doi]
AB  - Primary immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disorder in which platelet 
      destruction is a consequence of both B- and T-cell dysregulation. Flow cytometry was 
      used to further characterize the B- and T-cell compartments in a cross-sectional 
      cohort of 26 immune thrombocytopenia patients including antiplatelet antibody 
      positive (n=14) and negative (n=12) patients exposed to a range of therapies, and a 
      cohort of matched healthy volunteers. Markers for B-cell activating factor and its 
      receptors, relevant B-cell activation markers (CD95 and CD21) and markers for CD4(+) 
      T-cell subsets, including circulating T-follicular helper-like cells, were included. 
      Our results indicate that an expanded population of CD95(+) naïve B cells correlated 
      with disease activity in immune thrombocytopenia patients regardless of treatment 
      status. A population of CD21-naïve B cells was specifically expanded in 
      autoantibody-positive immune thrombocytopenia patients. Furthermore, the B-cell 
      maturation antigen, a receptor for B-cell activating factor, was consistently and 
      strongly up-regulated on plasmablasts from immune thrombocytopenia patients. These 
      observations have parallels in other autoantibody-mediated diseases and suggest that 
      loss of peripheral tolerance in naïve B cells may be an important component of 
      immune thrombocytopenia pathogenesis. Moreover, the B-cell maturation antigen 
      represents a potential target for plasma cell directed therapies in immune 
      thrombocytopenia.

TI  - Fc Receptor-like 5 Expression Distinguishes Two Distinct Subsets of Human 
      Circulating Tissue-like Memory B Cells.
PG  - 4064-74
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1501027 [doi]
AB  - Fc receptor-like (FCRL) 5 is a novel IgG binding protein expressed on B cells, with 
      the capacity to regulate Ag receptor signaling. We assessed FCRL5 expression on 
      circulating B cells from healthy donors and found that FCRL5(+) cells are most 
      enriched among atypical CD21(-/lo)/CD27(-) tissue-like memory (TLM) B cells, which 
      are abnormally expanded in several autoimmune and infectious diseases. Using 
      multicolor flow cytometry, FCRL5(+) TLM cells were found to express more CD11c and 
      several inhibitory receptors than did the FCRL5(-) TLM subset. The homing receptor 
      profiles of the two TLM subsets shared features consistent with migration away from 
      lymphoid tissues, but they also displayed distinct differences. Analysis of IgH V 
      regions in single cells indicated that although both subsets are diverse, the 
      FCRL5(+) subset accumulated significantly more somatic mutations. Furthermore, the 
      FCRL5(+) subset had more switched isotype expression and more extensive 
      proliferative history. Microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that 
      the two TLM subsets possess distinct gene expression profiles, characterized by 
      markedly different CD11c, SOX5, T-bet, and RTN4R expression, as well as differences 
      in expression of inhibitory receptors. Functional analysis revealed that the 
      FCRL5(+) TLM subset responds poorly to multiple stimuli compared with the FCRL5(-) 
      subset, as reflected by reduced calcium mobilization and blunted cell proliferation. 
      We propose that the FCRL5(+) TLM subset, but not the FCRL5(-) TLM subset, underwent 
      Ag-driven development and is severely dysfunctional. The present study elucidates 
      the heterogeneity of TLM B cells and provides the basis to dissect their roles in 
      the pathogenesis of inflammatory and infectious diseases.

LID - 10.2337/dc15-1765 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: B lymphocytes play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of 
      autoimmune diabetes. We hypothesized that the altered B-cell subset phenotype is 
      associated with autoimmune diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 
      1 diabetes (T1D) (n = 81), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) (n = 82), or 
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 95) and healthy control subjects (n = 218) with normal 
      glucose tolerance (NGT) were recruited. We determined the percentage of circulating 
      B-lymphocyte subsets, including CD19(+)CD23(-)CD21(+) (marginal zone B [MZB]), 
      CD19(+)CD23(+)CD21(-) (follicular B [FoB]), and CD19(+)CD5(+)CD1d(hi) 
      (interleukin-10-producing regulatory B [B10]) cells by flow cytometry. RESULTS: 
      Patients with T1D or LADA had increased percentages of MZB cells and decreased 
      percentages of FoB cells compared with healthy control subjects with NGT and 
      patients with T2D. Moreover, patients with T1D showed the lowest frequency of B10 
      cells compared with patients with LADA or T2D, whereas healthy control subjects 
      expressed the highest frequency of B10 cells. Of note, the frequency of MZB cells 
      was negatively associated and the frequency of FoB cells was positively associated 
      with fasting C-peptide (FCP). The frequency of B10 cells was positively correlated 
      with FCP and negatively correlated with hemoglobin A(1c). CONCLUSIONS: The data show 
      that patients with T1D or LADA express an altered frequency of B-cell subsets, which 
      is associated with islet function and glycemia. These findings suggest that B 
      lymphocytes may be involved in loss of self-tolerance and β-cell destruction and 
      could be used as a biomarker and potential target for immunological intervention.

LID - 10.5603/FHC.a2016.0005 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated 
      with production of antibodies to double stranded DNA, deposition of immune complexes 
      and organ damage. These processes have been linked with abnormalities in B- and 
      T-cell memory compartments. The aim of the study was to analyze subsets of 
      peripheral memory B-cells and T-cells in lupus nephritis (LN) patients. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: We used multicolor flow cytometry to analyze major memory subsets of 
      peripheral blood B-cells (defined by CD27, IgD and CD21) and T-cells (CD45RA, 
      CD45RO, CCR7) in 32 patients with active or inactive LN, and 23 control subjects. 
      RESULTS: Lupus nephritis patients were characterized by increased percentage of 
      immature/early-transitional B-cells (CD27-IgD+CD21-), higher frequency of activated 
      switched memory (SM, CD27+IgD-CD21-) and exhausted memory B-cells (CD27-IgD-), and 
      decrease in non-switched memory (NSM, CD27+IgD+) B-cells. CD21low subsets (immature 
      and activated B-cells) were particularly expanded in patients with active disease. 
      In both groups of LN patients we observed decline in the absolute count of NSM 
      B-cells. It was paralleled by lymphopenia in naïve CD4+ T-cell compartment and 
      increase in the frequency of effector memory T-cells, and these changes were more 
      pronounced in active LN. CONCLUSIONS: B-cell memory compartment in LN is deficient 
      in NSM cells and during active disease it is further skewed towards SM and exhausted 
      memory phenotypes, most likely as a cause of chronic antigenic stimulation. Parallel 
      changes in T-helper cell subsets suggest a similar mechanism of SLE-related 
      lymphopenia for both B-cell and T-cell compartment.

AB  - PURPOSE: Deficiencies in CD19 and CD81 (forming the CD19-complex with CD21 and 
      CD225) cause a severe clinical phenotype. One CD21 deficient patient has been 
      described. We present a second CD21 deficient patient, with a mild clinical 
      phenotype and compared the immunobiological characteristics of CD21 and CD19 
      deficiency. METHODS: CD21 deficiency was characterized by flowcytometric 
      immunophenotyping and sequencing. Real-time PCR, in vitro stimulation and next 
      generation sequencing were used to characterize B-cell responses and affinity 
      maturation in CD21(-/-) and CD19(-/-) B cells. RESULTS: A compound heterozygous 
      mutation in CD21 caused CD21 deficiency. CD21(-/-) B cells responded normally to in 
      vitro stimulation and AID was transcribed. Affinity maturation was less affected by 
      CD21 than by CD19 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Both CD21 and CD19 deficiencies cause 
      hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced memory B cells. CD19 deficiency causes a more 
      severe clinical phenotype. B-cell characteristics reflect this, both after in vitro 
      stimulation as in affinity maturation.

TI  - Phenotypic and Morphological Properties of Germinal Center Dark Zone 
      Cxcl12-Expressing Reticular Cells.
PG  - 4781-91
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1501191 [doi]
AB  - The germinal center (GC) is divided into a dark zone (DZ) and a light zone (LZ). GC 
      B cells must cycle between these zones to achieve efficient Ab affinity maturation. 
      Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are well characterized for their role in 
      supporting B cell Ag encounter in primary follicles and in the GC LZ. However, the 
      properties of stromal cells supporting B cells in the DZ are relatively unexplored. 
      Recent work identified a novel stromal population of Cxcl12-expressing reticular 
      cells (CRCs) in murine GC DZs. In this article, we report that CRCs have diverse 
      morphologies, appearing in open and closed networks, with variable distribution in 
      lymphoid tissue GCs. CRCs are also present in splenic and peripheral lymph node 
      primary follicles. Real-time two-photon microscopy of Peyer's patch GCs demonstrates 
      B cells moving in close association with CRC processes. CRCs are gp38(+) with low to 
      undetectable expression of FDC markers, but CRC-like cells in the DZ are lineage 
      marked, along with FDCs and fibroblastic reticular cells, by CD21-Cre- and 
      Ccl19-Cre-directed fluorescent reporters. In contrast to FDCs, CRCs do not 
      demonstrate dependence on lymphotoxin or TNF for chemokine expression or network 
      morphology. CRC distribution in the DZ does require CXCR4 signaling, which is 
      necessary for GC B cells to access the DZ and likely to interact with CRC processes. 
      Our findings establish CRCs as a major stromal cell type in the GC DZ and suggest 
      that CRCs support critical activities of GC B cells in the DZ niche through Cxcl12 
      expression and direct cell-cell interactions.

TI  - CD21 -/low B cells: A Snapshot of a Unique B Cell Subset in Health and Disease.
PG  - 254-61
LID - 10.1111/sji.12339 [doi]
AB  - B cells represent one of the cellular components of the immune system that protects 
      the individual from invading pathogens. In response to the invader, these cells 
      differentiate into plasma cells and produce large amounts of antibodies that bind to 
      and eliminate the pathogen. A hallmark of autoimmune diseases is the production of 
      autoantibodies i.e. antibodies that recognize self. Those that are considered 
      pathogenic can damage tissues and organs, either by direct binding or when deposited 
      as immune complexes. For decades, B cells have been considered to play a major role 
      in autoimmune diseases by antibody production. However, as pathogenic autoantibodies 
      appear to derive mainly from T cell dependent responses, T cells have been the focus 
      for many years. The successful treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases with 
      either B cell depletion therapy (rituximab) or inhibition of B cell survival 
      (belimumab), suggested that not only the autoantibodies but also other B cell 
      features are important. This has caused a surge of interest in B cells and their 
      biology resulting in the identification of various subsets e.g. regulatory B cells, 
      several memory B cell subsets etc. Also, in other conditions such as chronic viral 
      infections and primary immunodeficiency, several B cell subsets with unique 
      characteristics have been identified. In this review, we will discuss one of these 
      subsets, a subset that is expanded in conditions characterized by chronic immune 
      stimulation. This B cell subset lacks, or expresses low, surface levels of the 
      complement receptor 2 (CD21) and has therefore been termed CD21(-/low) B cells.

AB  - A 2-year and 6-month-old female neutered Labrador Retriever with Horner syndrome, 
      megaesophagus, and a mediastinal mass was referred to the Queen Mother Hospital for 
      Animals of the Royal Veterinary College. A large granular lymphocyte (LGL) lymphoma 
      was diagnosed on cytology; flow cytometric analysis revealed a γδ T-cell phenotype 
      (CD3+, CD5+, CD45+, TCRγδ+, CD4-, CD8-, CD34-, CD21-). Chemotherapy was started with 
      a combination of lomustine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisolone, followed by 
      bleyomicin. Euthanasia was elected by the owners, due to progressive deterioration 
      and lack of quality of life, 28 days after diagnosis. This is the first cytologic 
      and immunophenotypic characterization of a canine γδ T-cell lymphoma with LGL 
      morphology and probably of mediastinal origin. The role of chemotherapy in delaying 
      the disease progression remains unknown.

TI  - B-cell reconstitution after lentiviral vector-mediated gene therapy in patients with 
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a severe X-linked immunodeficiency 
      characterized by microthrombocytopenia, eczema, recurrent infections, and 
      susceptibility to autoimmunity and lymphomas. Hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation is the treatment of choice; however, administration of WAS 
      gene-corrected autologous hematopoietic stem cells has been demonstrated as a 
      feasible alternative therapeutic approach. OBJECTIVE: Because B-cell homeostasis is 
      perturbed in patients with WAS and restoration of immune competence is one of the 
      main therapeutic goals, we have evaluated reconstitution of the B-cell compartment 
      in 4 patients who received autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with 
      lentiviral vector after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen combined with 
      anti-CD20 administration. METHODS: We evaluated B-cell counts, B-cell subset 
      distribution, B cell-activating factor and immunoglobulin levels, and autoantibody 
      production before and after gene therapy (GT). WAS gene transfer in B cells was 
      assessed by measuring vector copy numbers and expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome 
      protein. RESULTS: After lentiviral vector-mediated GT, the number of transduced B 
      cells progressively increased in the peripheral blood of all patients. Lentiviral 
      vector-transduced progenitor cells were able to repopulate the B-cell compartment 
      with a normal distribution of B-cell subsets both in bone marrow and the periphery, 
      showing a WAS protein expression profile similar to that of healthy donors. In 
      addition, after GT, we observed a normalized frequency of autoimmune-associated 
      CD19(+)CD21(-)CD35(-) and CD21(low) B cells and a reduction in B cell-activating 
      factor levels. Immunoglobulin serum levels and autoantibody production improved in 
      all treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that lentiviral 
      vector-mediated GT induces transgene expression in the B-cell compartment, resulting 
      in ameliorated B-cell development and functionality and contributing to immunologic 
      improvement in patients with WAS.

AB  - Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a common complication after allogeneic 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which is also one of the major 
      causes of patients' death following transplantation. Recently, extracorporeal 
      photochemotherapy (ECP) has shown a considerable efficacy in cGVHD treatment, which 
      is based on the infusion of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected 
      by aphesis, incubated with the photoactivable drug 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and 
      UV-A irradiation. The therapeutic effect of ECP is mainly achieved by the induction 
      of cell apoptosis, influencing the function of dendritic cells and the induction of 
      immune tolerance. ECP has many advantages in the treatment of cGVHD, such as no 
      increasing the risk of infection in patients, unaffecting the graft-versus-leukemia 
      effect, nearly no side effect and so on. Many medical centers have done a lot of 
      research on the treatment of cGVHD in both children and adults by using ECP and 
      achieved good results. CD19(+) CD21(-) B lymphocytes, serum BAFF and serum TNFα can 
      be used to measure and early evaluate the efficacy of ECP treatment. The effect of 
      ECP is associated with many factors, and certain complications may occur during the 
      treatment. At present, the application of ECP treatment is limited by the unclear 
      mechanisms, varying treatment cycles in different studies, and small number of 
      patients in clinical research. In the near future, with deeper basic research, 
      increasing the case number and standard clinical treatment, ECP will have a more 
      extensive application prospects. This review focuses mainly on the clinical advances 
      of ECP in the treatment of cGVHD.

AB  - Porcine ileum is populated with a high proportion of B cells but previous studies 
      have shown that they are not developed there. While B cells prevail in the ileum 
      even in germ-free animals, microbial colonization is a major factor that causes even 
      a greater prevalence of B cells in the ileum and further differential representation 
      of lymphoid cells throughout small intestine. Analysis of lymphoid subpopulations 
      showed that the effector cells appear only after colonization. These include 
      class-switched IgM(+)IgA(+) B cells, primed CD2(-)CD21(+) B cells, 
      antibody-producing/memory CD2(+)CD21(-) B cells, and effector/memory CD4(+)CD8(+) αβ 
      Th cells. While colonization resulted in a uniform distribution of effector cells 
      throughout the gut, it caused a decrease in the frequency of cytotoxic αβ and 
      CD2(+)CD8(+) γδ T cells. These results suggest that the ileum is a site where naive 
      B cells expand presumably to increase antibody repertoire but the entire small 
      intestine is immunofunctionally comparable.

AB  - Antiretroviral therapy (ART) only partially restores HIV-induced alterations in 
      lymphocyte populations. We assessed B and T cell phenotypes in a cohort of children 
      from a single centre in the United Kingdom with perinatally acquired HIV compared to 
      healthy controls. The majority of HIV infected children (44 of 56) were on fully 
      suppressive combination ART. Children with perinatally acquired HIV had 
      significantly lower memory B and CD4(+) CD45RO(+) CXCR5(+) [follicular T helper cell 
      (Tfh)-like] T cell percentages. Detectable viraemia was associated with higher 
      CD21(-) (activated and exhausted/tissue-like memory) B cells. A greater proportion 
      of life spent on suppressive ART was associated with higher memory B cell 
      percentages. These results suggest that early and sustained suppressive ART may 
      preserve B and T cell phenotypes in perinatally acquired HIV and limit deficits in 
      humoral immunity. A lower proportion of circulating Tfh-like cells in HIV infected 
      children appears to be independent of HIV treatment history and ongoing HIV viraemia 
      and warrants further investigation.

      Impact of B Cell Depletion Therapy, and Biomarkers of Response.
PG  - e0128269

LID - e0128269
AB  - Although B cell depletion therapy (BCDT) is effective in a subset of rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) patients, both mechanisms and biomarkers of response are poorly 
      defined. Here we characterized abnormalities in B cell populations in RA and the 
      impact of BCDT in order to elucidate B cell roles in the disease and response 
      biomarkers. In active RA patients both CD27+IgD- switched memory (SM) and CD27-IgD- 
      double negative memory (DN) peripheral blood B cells contained significantly higher 
      fractions of CD95+ and CD21- activated cells compared to healthy controls. After BCD 
      the predominant B cell populations were memory, and residual memory B cells 
      displayed a high fraction of CD21- and CD95+ compared to pre-depletion indicating 
      some resistance of these activated populations to anti-CD20. The residual memory 
      populations also expressed more Ki-67 compared to pre-treatment, suggesting 
      homeostatic proliferation in the B cell depleted state. Biomarkers of clinical 
      response included lower CD95+ activated memory B cells at depletion time points and 
      a higher ratio of transitional B cells to memory at reconstitution. B cell function 
      in terms of cytokine secretion was dependent on B cell subset and changed with BCD. 
      Thus, SM B cells produced pro-inflammatory (TNF) over regulatory (IL10) cytokines as 
      compared to naïve/transitional. Notably, B cell TNF production decreased after BCDT 
      and reconstitution compared to untreated RA. Our results support the hypothesis that 
      the clinical and immunological outcome of BCDT depends on the relative balance of 
      protective and pathogenic B cell subsets established after B cell depletion and 
      repopulation.

AB  - Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a pivotal role in both 
      innate and adaptive immunity. IL-15 is also a promising cytokine for treating 
      cancer. Despite the growing importance of the clinical use of IL-15 for 
      immunotherapy, no attempts have been made to generate a recombinant canine IL-15 
      (rcIL-15) and to examine its effects on the antitumor activities of immune effector 
      cells in dogs. Here, we generated an rcIL-15 protein consisting of Asn-49-Ser-162 
      with a C-terminal His tag and examined its functions ex vivo in terms of the 
      proliferation and antitumor effects on canine non-B, non-T, large granular natural 
      killer (NK) cells. Non-B, non-T, large granular NK cells rapidly expanded in 
      response to stimulation with rcIL-15 in the presence of IL-2, and a majority of the 
      cells that selectively expanded over 21 days exhibited a 
      CD3(-)CD5(-)CD4(-)CD8(+/-)CD21(-) phenotype. Purified rcIL-15 significantly enhanced 
      the expansion rate of canine NK cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells compared to human IL-15, or culture in the absence of IL-15 for 21 days 
      (p<0.05). Purified rcIL-15 was superior at enhancing the effector function of NK 
      cells compared to human IL-15. The cytotoxic activity against canine thyroid 
      adenocarcinoma (CTAC) cells, interferon-γ production, and the mRNA expression levels 
      of perforin and granzyme B of expanded NK cells cultured with rcIL-15 were 
      significantly elevated compared to those cultured with human IL-15 or without IL-15 
      (p<0.05). Intravenous administration of rcIL-15 significantly increased the numbers 
      of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of dogs on days 6, 8, and 11 after injection 
      compared to numbers before administration (p<0.05). The results of this study 
      suggest that the rcIL-15 protein, consisting of Asn-49-Ser-162, enhanced the 
      proliferation and antitumor effects of canine NK cells and promoted the generation 
      of lymphocytes in dogs.

AB  - Interleukin (IL)-21 is an important modulator of natural killer (NK) cell function. 
      However, little is known about IL-21 function in canine NK cells because the 
      phenotype of these cells remains undefined. In this study, we selectively expanded 
      non-B and non-T large granular NK lymphocytes 
      (CD3(-)CD21(-)CD5(-)CD4(-)TCRαβ(-)TCRγδ(-)) ex vivo from the peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy dogs using a combination of IL-2, IL-15, and 
      IL-21 in the presence of 100 Gy-irradiated K562 cells. We investigated the effects 
      of varying the duration and timing of IL-21 treatment on stimulation of 
      proliferation, expression of NK-related receptors, anti-tumor activity and 
      production of interferon (IFN)-γ. The expanded NK cells in each treatment group 
      became enlarged and highly granular after 21 days in culture. NK cells proliferated 
      rapidly in response to activation by IL-21 for 3 weeks, and IL-21 was able to induce 
      changes in the mRNA expression of NK cell-related receptors and enhance the effector 
      function of NK cells in perforin- and granzyme-B-dependent manners. The duration, 
      frequency and timing of IL-21 stimulation during culture affected the rate of 
      proliferation, patterns of receptor expression, cytokine production, and anti-tumor 
      activity. The optimal conditions for maximizing the IL-21-induced proliferation and 
      effector function of NK cells in the presence of IL-2 and IL-15 were seen in cells 
      treated with IL-21 for the first 7 days of culture but without any further IL-21 
      stimulation other than an additional 2-day treatment prior to harvesting on day 21. 
      The results of this study suggest that synergistic interactions of IL-21 with IL-2 
      and IL-15 play an important role in the proliferation, receptor expression, and 
      effector function of canine NK cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Humoral and cellular immune responses play protective roles against 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. However, hookworm infection decreases 
      the immune response to hookworm and bystander antigens. Currently, immune responses 
      to co-infection of MTB and hookworm are still unknown, although co-infection has 
      been one of the public health problems in co-endemic areas of pulmonary tuberculosis 
      (PTB) and hookworm disease. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate B and T cell 
      immune responses to the co-infection. METHODS: Seventeen PTB cases co-infected with 
      hookworm, 26 PTB cases, 15 patients with hookworm infection, and 24 healthy controls 
      without PTB or hookworm infection were enrolled in the study. Expressions of CD3, 
      CD4, CD8, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD25, CD27, CD38, FoxP3, and PD-1 were assessed on 
      B and T cell subsets using multicolor flow cytometry. RESULTS: For the B cell 
      (CD19(+)) subsets, naïve B cells (CD10(-)CD27(-)CD21(+)CD20(+)), plasma cells 
      (CD10(-)CD27(+)CD21(-)CD20(-)), and tissue-like memory B cells 
      (CD10(-)CD27(-)CD21(-)CD20(+)) had higher proportions, whilst resting memory B cells 
      (CD10(-)CD27(+)CD21(+)CD20(+)) had lower proportions in the group co-infected with 
      MTB and hookworm as compared to other groups. Frequencies of activated memory B 
      cells (CD10(-)CD27(+)CD21(-)CD20(+)) did not differ among the four groups. For the T 
      cell (CD3(+)) subsets, frequencies of regulatory T cells (CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)) and 
      exhausted CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (CD4(+)PD-1(+) and CD8(+)PD-1(+)) were higher, 
      and frequencies of activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (CD4(+)CD38(+) and 
      CD8(+)CD38(+)) were lower in the co-infected group as compared to the other groups. 
      CONCLUSION: The change patterns of the cell profile of circulating lymphocytes were 
      indentified in human co-infection of MTB and hookworm, which might indicate that the 
      humoral and cellular immune responses are more suppressed.

      been linked to a deficiency in antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum antigens; 
      however, prior studies have only focused on the antibody response to <0.5% of P. 
      falciparum proteins. To obtain a broader and less-biased view of the effect of HIV 
      on antibody responses to malaria we compared antibody profiles of HIV positive 
      (HIV+) and negative (HIV-) Rwandan adults with symptomatic malaria using a 
      microarray containing 824 P. falciparum proteins. We also investigated the cellular 
      basis of the antibody response in the two groups by analyzing B and T cell subsets 
      by flow cytometry. Although HIV malaria co-infected individuals generated antibodies 
      to a large number of P. falciparum antigens, including potential vaccine candidates, 
      the breadth and magnitude of their response was reduced compared to HIV- 
      individuals. HIV malaria co-infection was also associated with a higher percentage 
      of atypical memory B cells (MBC) (CD19+CD10-CD21-CD27-) compared to malaria 
      infection alone. Among HIV+ individuals the CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load 
      only partially explained variability in the breadth of P. falciparum-specific 
      antibody responses. Taken together, these data indicate that HIV malaria 
      co-infection is associated with an expansion of atypical MBCs and a diminished 
      antibody response to a diverse array of P. falciparum antigens, thus offering 
      mechanistic insight into the higher risk of malaria in HIV+ individuals.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells play critical roles in induction of antiviral effects 
      against various viruses of humans and animals. However, few data on NK cell 
      activities during canine distemper virus (CDV) infections are available. Recently, 
      we established a culture system allowing activation and expansion of canine non-B, 
      non-T, large granular NK lymphocytes from PBMCs of normal dogs. In the present 
      study, we explored the ability of such expanded NK cells to inhibit CDV infection in 
      vitro. Cultured CD3-CD5-CD21- NK cells produced large amounts of IFN-γ, exhibited 
      highly upregulated expression of mRNAs encoding NK-cell-associated receptors, and 
      demonstrated strong natural killing activity against canine tumor cells. Although 
      the expanded NK cells were dose-dependently cytotoxic to both normal and 
      CDV-infected Vero cells, CDV infection rendered Vero cells more susceptible to NK 
      cells. Pretreatment with anti-CDV serum from hyperimmunized dogs enhanced the 
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of NK cells against CDV-infected 
      Vero cells. The culture supernatants of NK cells, added before or after infection, 
      dose-dependently inhibited both CDV replication and development of CDV-induced 
      cytopathic effects (CPEs) in Vero cells. Anti-IFN-γ antibody neutralized the 
      inhibitory effects of NK cell culture supernatants on CDV replication and CPE 
      induction in Vero cells. Such results emphasize the potential significance of NK 
      cells in controlling CDV infection, and indicate that NK cells may play roles both 
      during CDV infection and in combating such infections, under certain conditions.

AB  - Influenza infections have high frequency and morbidity in HIV-infected pregnant 
      women, underscoring the importance of vaccine-conferred protection. To identify the 
      factors that determine vaccine immunogenicity in this group, we characterized the 
      relationship of B- and T-cell responses to pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) vaccine with 
      HIV-associated immunologic and virologic characteristics. pH1N1 and seasonal-H1N1 
      (sH1N1) antibodies were measured in 119 HIV-infected pregnant women after two 
      double-strength pH1N1 vaccine doses. pH1N1-IgG and IgA B-cell FluoroSpot, pH1N1- and 
      sH1N1-interferon γ (IFNγ) and granzyme B (GrB) T-cell FluoroSpot, and flow 
      cytometric characterization of B- and T-cell subsets were performed in 57 subjects. 
      pH1N1-antibodies increased after vaccination, but less than previously described in 
      healthy adults. pH1N1-IgG memory B cells (Bmem) increased, IFNγ-effector T-cells 
      (Teff) decreased, and IgA Bmem and GrB Teff did not change. pH1N1-antibodies and 
      Teff were significantly correlated with each other and with sH1N1-HAI and Teff, 
      respectively, before and after vaccination. pH1N1-antibody responses to the vaccine 
      significantly increased with high proportions of CD4+, low CD8+ and low 
      CD8+HLADR+CD38+ activated (Tact) cells. pH1N1-IgG Bmem responses increased with high 
      proportions of CD19+CD27+CD21- activated B cells (Bact), high CD8+CD39+ regulatory T 
      cells (Treg), and low CD19+CD27-CD21- exhausted B cells (Bexhaust). IFNγ-Teff 
      responses increased with low HIV plasma RNA, CD8+HLADR+CD38+ Tact, CD4+FoxP3+ Treg 
      and CD19+IL10+ Breg. In conclusion, pre-existing antibody and Teff responses to 
      sH1N1 were associated with increased responses to pH1N1 vaccination in HIV-infected 
      pregnant women suggesting an important role for heterosubtypic immunologic memory. 
      High CD4+% T cells were associated with increased, whereas high HIV replication, 
      Tact and Bexhaust were associated with decreased vaccine immunogenicity. High Treg 
      increased antibody responses but decreased Teff responses to the vaccine. The 
      proportions of immature and transitional B cells did not affect the responses to 
      vaccine. Increased Bact were associated with high Bmem responses to the vaccine.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated immune determinants of antibody responses and B-cell 
      memory to pH1N1 vaccine in HIV-infected children. METHODS: Ninety subjects 4 to <25 
      years of age received two double doses of pH1N1 vaccine. Serum and cells were frozen 
      at baseline, after each vaccination, and at 28 weeks post-immunization. 
      Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers, avidity indices (AI), B-cell subsets, and 
      pH1N1 IgG and IgA antigen secreting cells (ASC) were measured at baseline and after 
      each vaccination. Neutralizing antibodies and pH1N1-specific Th1, Th2 and Tfh 
      cytokines were measured at baseline and post-dose 1. RESULTS: At entry, 26 (29%) 
      subjects had pH1N1 protective HAI titers (≥1:40). pH1N1-specific HAI, neutralizing 
      titers, AI, IgG ASC, IL-2 and IL-4 increased in response to vaccination (p<0.05), 
      but IgA ASC, IL-5, IL-13, IL-21, IFNγ and B-cell subsets did not change. Subjects 
      with baseline HAI ≥1:40 had significantly greater increases in IgG ASC and AI after 
      immunization compared with those with HAI <1:40. Neutralizing titers and AI after 
      vaccination increased with older age. High pH1N1 HAI responses were associated with 
      increased IgG ASC, IFNγ, IL-2, microneutralizion titers, and AI. Microneutralization 
      titers after vaccination increased with high IgG ASC and IL-2 responses. IgG ASC 
      also increased with high IFNγ responses. CD4% and viral load did not predict the 
      immune responses post-vaccination, but the B-cell distribution did. Notably, vaccine 
      immunogenicity increased with high CD19+CD21+CD27+% resting memory, high 
      CD19+CD10+CD27+% immature activated, low CD19+CD21-CD27-CD20-% tissue-like, low 
      CD19+CD21-CD27-CD20-% transitional and low CD19+CD38+HLADR+% activated B-cell 
      subsets. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected children on HAART mount a broad B-cell memory 
      response to pH1N1 vaccine, which was higher for subjects with baseline HAI≥1:40 and 
      increased with age, presumably due to prior exposure to pH1N1 or to other influenza 
      vaccination/infection. The response to the vaccine was dependent on B-cell subset 
      distribution, but not on CD4 counts or viral load. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - The V gene repertoires of classical and atypical memory B cells in 
      malaria-susceptible West African children.
PG  - 929-39
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1402168 [doi]
AB  - Immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria is naturally acquired in individuals 
      living in malaria-endemic areas of Africa. Abs play a key role in mediating this 
      immunity; however, the acquisition of the components of Ab immunity, long-lived 
      plasma cells and memory B cells (MBCs), is remarkably inefficient, requiring years 
      of malaria exposure. Although long-lived classical MBCs 
      (CD19(+)/CD20(+)/CD21(+)/CD27(+)/CD10(-)) are gradually acquired in response to 
      natural infection, exposure to P. falciparum also results in a large expansion of 
      what we have termed atypical MBCs (CD19(+)/CD20(+)/CD21(-)/CD27(-)/CD10(-)). At 
      present, the function of atypical MBCs in malaria is not known, nor are the factors 
      that drive their differentiation. To gain insight into the relationship between 
      classical and atypical IgG(+) MBCs, we compared the Ab H and L chain V gene 
      repertoires of children living in a malaria-endemic region in Mali. We found that 
      these repertoires were remarkably similar by a variety of criteria, including V gene 
      usage, rate of somatic hypermutation, and CDR-H3 length and composition. The 
      similarity in these repertoires suggests that classical MBCs and atypical MBCs 
      differentiate in response to similar Ag-dependent selective pressures in 
      malaria-exposed children and that atypical MBCs do not express a unique V gene 
      repertoire.

TI  - C3d adjuvant effects are mediated through the activation of C3d-specific 
      autoreactive T cells.
PG  - 189-97
LID - 10.1038/icb.2014.89 [doi]
AB  - Complement fragment C3d covalently attached to antigens enhances immune responses, 
      particularly for antigens lacking T-cell epitopes. Enhancement has been attributed 
      to receptor cross-linking between complement receptor CR2 (CD21) and polysaccharide 
      antigen to surface IgM on naïve B cells. Paradoxically, C3d has still been shown to 
      increase immune responses in CD21 knockout mice, suggesting that an auxiliary 
      activation pathway exists. In prior studies, we demonstrated the CD21-independent 
      C3d adjuvant effect might be due to T-cell recognition of C3d T-helper epitopes 
      processed and presented by major histocompatibility complex class II on the B-cell 
      surface. C3d peptide sequences containing concentrated clusters of putative human C3 
      T-cell epitopes were identified using the epitope-mapping algorithm, EpiMatrix. 
      These peptide sequences were synthesized and shown in vitro to bind multiple human 
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR alleles with high affinity, and induce interferon-γ 
      responses in healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In the present 
      studies, we establish further correlations between HLA binding and HLA-specific 
      lymphocyte reactions with select epitope clusters. In addition, we show that the 
      T-cell phenotype of C3d-specific reactive T cells is CD4(+)CD45RO(+) memory T cells. 
      Finally, mutation of a single T-cell epitope residing within the P28 peptide segment 
      of C3d resulted in significantly diminished adjuvant activity in BALB/c mice. 
      Collectively, these studies support the hypothesis that the paradoxical enhancement 
      of immune responses by C3d in the absence of CD21 is due to internalization and 
      processing of C3d into peptides that activate autoreactive CD4(+) T-helper cells in 
      the context of HLA class II.

AB  - Autoimmune cytopenia is a frequent manifestation of primary immunodeficiencies. Two 
      siblings presented with Evans syndrome, viral infections, and progressive 
      leukopenia. DNA available from one patient showed a homozygous frameshift mutation 
      in tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP2) abolishing protein expression. TPP2 is a serine 
      exopeptidase involved in extralysosomal peptide degradation. Its deficiency in mice 
      activates cell death programs and premature senescence. Similar to cells from naïve, 
      uninfected TPP2-deficient mice, patient cells showed increased major 
      histocompatibility complex I expression and most CD8(+) T-cells had a senescent 
      CCR7-CD127(-)CD28(-)CD57(+) phenotype with poor proliferative responses and enhanced 
      staurosporine-induced apoptosis. T-cells showed increased expression of the effector 
      molecules perforin and interferon-γ with high expression of the transcription factor 
      T-bet. Age-associated B-cells with a CD21(-) CD11c(+) phenotype expressing T-bet 
      were increased in humans and mice, combined with antinuclear antibodies. Moreover, 
      markers of senescence were also present in human and murine TPP2-deficient 
      fibroblasts. Telomere lengths were normal in patient fibroblasts and granulocytes, 
      and low normal in lymphocytes, which were compatible with activation of 
      stress-induced rather than replicative senescence programs. TPP2 deficiency is the 
      first primary immunodeficiency linking premature immunosenescence to severe 
      autoimmunity. Determination of senescent lymphocytes should be part of the 
      diagnostic evaluation of children with refractory multilineage cytopenias.

      hyperactivity and autoantibody production. As spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is 
      pivotal in B cell activation, these experiments aimed to examine the extent to which 
      Syk was abnormally expressed in SLE B cells and the nature of the B cell subset that 
      differently expressed Syk. METHODS: B cells from healthy donors and SLE patients 
      were analyzed by flow cytometry to assess basal expression of Syk and phosphorylated 
      Syk. B cell subsets expressing higher levels of Syk were found, and their detailed 
      phenotype, in vitro differentiation into plasmablasts/plasma cells, and Syk 
      induction by cytokines were determined. RESULTS: Syk expression was higher in CD27+ 
      memory B cells than in naive B cells from SLE patients. However, a significantly 
      increased frequency of CD27- B cells with bright expression of Syk (Syk++) was found 
      in SLE patients. CD27-Syk++ B cells showed enhanced basal expression of p-Syk and 
      stronger Syk phosphorylation upon B cell receptor (BCR) engagement as compared to 
      CD27-Syk+ B cells. CD27-Syk++ B cells were CD38- as well as CD19++, CD20++, and 
      mainly CD21-, with decreased ABCB1 transporter activity. In contrast to CD27-Syk+ B 
      cells, CD27-Syk++ B cells exhibited enhanced differentiation into CD27++ 
      IgG-secreting cells and expressed somatically mutated BCR gene rearrangements. Syk++ 
      B cells were inducible in vitro by stimulation with interferon-γ, 
      lipopolysaccharide, or tumor necrosis factor α. CONCLUSION: SLE patients exhibit an 
      increased frequency of hitherto unknown CD27-Syk++ memory-like B cells, indicating 
      that intracellular Syk density could distinguish CD27- memory B cells from truly 
      naive B cell subsets. Furthermore, the CD27-Syk++ subset is a candidate for a source 
      of increased plasma cells in SLE.

TI  - Primary γδ T cell lymphoma of the lung: report of a case with features suggesting 
      derivation from intraepithelial γδ T lymphocytes.
PG  - 731-6

AB  - T cell lymphoma of γδ T cell origin is a rare disease that mainly involves 
      extranodal sites and shows aggressive clinical behavior. Here, we report a case of 
      primary γδ T cell lymphoma of the lungs with epitheliotropism in the respiratory 
      epithelium, a feature somewhat reminiscent of what is observed in 
      enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. A 63-year-old man presented with chest pain 
      and dyspnea on exertion, weight loss, and general weakness. On a positron emission 
      tomography (PET) scan, multiple hypermetabolic lesions were found in both lungs. 
      Microscopic examination of the wedge lung biopsy revealed nodular infiltration of 
      monomorphic, medium- to large-sized atypical lymphocytes with round nuclei, coarse 
      chromatin, and a variable amount of clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm. Of note, 
      intraepithelial lymphocytosis by atypical lymphoid cells was observed in the 
      respiratory epithelium within and around the nodule. Immunohistochemically, the 
      tumor cells were CD3+, TCRβF1-, TCRγ+, CD5-, CD7+, CD20-, CD79a-, CD30-, CD4-, CD8-, 
      CD10-, BCL6-, CD21-, CD56+, CD57-, and CD138-, and expressed cytotoxic molecules. 
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was not detected by an in situ hybridization assay for 
      EBV-encoded RNA. Interestingly, CD103 was expressed by a subset of tumor cells, 
      especially those infiltrating the epithelium. T cell clonality was detected by 
      multiplex PCR analysis of TRG and TRD gene rearrangements. After 2 months of 
      systemic chemotherapy, PET scan showed regression of the size and metabolic activity 
      of the lesions. This case represents a unique γδ T cell lymphoma of the lungs 
      showing epitheliotropism by CD103+ γδ T cells that is suggestive of tissue-resident 
      γδ T cells as the cell of origin.

TI  - C3d plasma levels and CD21 expressing B-cells in children after ABO-incompatible 
      heart transplantation: Alterations associated with blood group tolerance.
PG  - 1149-56

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most children transplanted with ABO-incompatible (ABOi) hearts develop 
      selective tolerance to donor A/B antigens, whereas anti-A/B antibodies typically 
      re-accumulate in adults after ABOi kidney transplantation. Deficiency of essential 
      factors linking innate and adaptive immunity in early childhood may promote 
      development of tolerance, specifically interactions between complement split product 
      C3d and its ligand CD21 on B cells, considering their role in augmenting 
      "T-independent" B-cell activation. METHODS: Blood and clinical data were analyzed 
      from children after ABOi or ABO-compatible (ABOc) heart transplantation (HTx). 
      Plasma C3d levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) were phenotyped by flow cytometry; expression of B-cell 
      co-receptor components CD21 and CD81 was quantified. RESULTS: Fifty-five samples 
      from pediatric HTx recipients (median age at transplant: 4.2 [range 0.03 to 20.4] 
      months; age at sample collection: 14.6 [0.04 to 51.3] months; 53% ABOi) and 21 
      controls were studied. CD21-expressing B cells increased in trend with age (p = 
      0.079); longitudinal measures in individual patients showed a strong correlation 
      with age. CD21 expression intensity in B-cells was not age-dependent. Plasma C3d 
      levels did not correlate with age. Comparing ABOc vs ABOi HTx, CD21-expressing cell 
      proportions were similar; however, serum C3d levels were significantly lower after 
      ABOi HTx (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In children, including HTx patients, 
      CD21-expressing B-cells show a trend to increase with age, corresponding with 
      improved responsiveness to polysaccharide antigens. This does not differ in patients 
      with ABOi grafts developing tolerance to donor ABO antigens. C3d levels are not 
      age-dependent, but reduced C3d levels after ABOi HTx suggest altered complement 
      metabolism contributing to ABO tolerance.

AB  - As vaccine-elicited antibodies have now been associated with HIV protective 
      efficacy, a thorough understanding of mucosal and systemic B-cell development and 
      maturation is needed. We phenotyped mucosal memory B-cells, investigated isotype 
      expression and homing patterns, and defined plasmablasts and plasma cells at three 
      mucosal sites (duodenum, jejunum and rectum) in rhesus macaques, the commonly used 
      animal model for pre-clinical vaccine studies. Unlike humans, macaque mucosal memory 
      B-cells lacked CD27 expression; only two sub-populations were present: naïve 
      (CD21(+)CD27(-)) and tissue-like (CD21(-)CD27(-)) memory. Similar to humans, IgA was 
      the dominant isotype expressed. The homing markers CXCR4, CCR6, CCR9 and α4β7 were 
      differentially expressed between naïve and tissue-like memory B-cells. Mucosal 
      plasmablasts were identified as CD19(+)CD20(+/-)HLA-DR(+)Ki-67(+)IRF4(+)CD138(+/-) 
      and mucosal plasma cells as CD19(+)CD20(-)HLA-DR(-)Ki-67(-)IRF4(+)CD138(+). Both 
      populations were CD39(+/-)CD27(-). Plasma cell phenotype was confirmed by 
      spontaneous IgA secretion by ELISpot of positively-selected cells and J-chain 
      expression by real-time PCR. Duodenal, jejunal and rectal samples were similar in 
      B-cell memory phenotype, isotype expression, homing receptors and plasmablast/plasma 
      cell distribution among the three tissues. Thus rectal biopsies adequately monitor 
      B-cell dynamics in the gut mucosa, and provide a critical view of mucosal B-cell 
      events associated with development of vaccine-elicited protective immune responses 
      and SIV/SHIV pathogenesis and disease control.

TI  - Analysis of host gene expression changes reveals distinct roles for the cytoplasmic 
      domain of the Epstein-Barr virus receptor/CD21 in B-cell maturation, activation, and 
      initiation of virus infection.
PG  - 5559-77
LID - 10.1128/JVI.03099-13 [doi]
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) attachment to human CD21 on the B-cell surface initiates 
      infection. Whether CD21 is a simple tether or conveys vital information to the cell 
      interior for production of host factors that promote infection of primary B cells is 
      controversial, as the cytoplasmic fragment of CD21 is short, though highly 
      conserved. The ubiquity of CD21 on normal B cells, the diversity of this population, 
      and the well-known resistance of primary B cells to gene transfer technologies have 
      all impeded resolution of this question. To uncover the role(s) of the CD21 
      cytoplasmic domain during infection initiation, the full-length receptor (CD21=CR), 
      a mutant lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail (CT), and a control vector (NEO) were 
      stably expressed in two pre-B-cell lines that lack endogenous receptor. Genome-wide 
      transcriptional analysis demonstrated that stable CD21 surface expression alone 
      (either CR or CT) produced multiple independent changes in gene expression, though 
      both dramatically decreased class I melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family RNAs 
      and upregulated genes associated with B-cell differentiation (e.g., C2TA, HLA-II, 
      IL21R, MIC2, CD48, and PTPRCAP/CD45-associated protein). Temporal analysis spanning 
      72 h revealed that not only CR- but also CT-expressing lines initiated latency. In 
      spite of this, the number and spectrum of transcripts altered in CR- compared with 
      CT-bearing lines at 1 h after infection further diverged. Differential modulation of 
      immediate early cellular transcripts (e.g., c-Jun and multiple histones), both novel 
      and previously linked to CD21-initiated signaling, as well as distinct results from 
      pathway analyses support a separate role for the cytoplasmic domain in initiation of 
      intracellular signals. IMPORTANCE: Membrane proteins that mediate virus attachment 
      tether virus particles to the cell surface, initiating infection. In addition, upon 
      virus interaction such proteins may transmit signals to the interior of the cell 
      that support subsequent steps in the infection process. Here we show that expression 
      of the Epstein-Barr virus B-cell attachment receptor, CD21, in B cells that lack 
      this receptor results in significant changes in gene expression, both before and 
      rapidly following EBV-CD21 interaction. These changes translate into major signaling 
      pathway alterations that are predicted to support stable infection.

TI  - Early highly active antiretroviral therapy enhances B-cell longevity: a 5 year 
      follow up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that an early initiation of highly active 
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-1 vertically infected children enhanced the 
      function of memory B-cells gained during childhood routine vaccinations. On the 
      other hand, a significant waning of immunity was observed for patients with a late 
      treatment. In this follow-up study, we report data from a sample of patients in our 
      cohort including late-treated patients being revaccinated with routine childhood 
      vaccines. METHODS: The levels of serum antibodies and cellular immunity were 
      measured by antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and B-cell ELISpot. 
      Moreover, flow cytometry on the frequencies of mature-activated (CD10-CD21-) and 
      double-negative (CD27-IgD-) B-cells as hallmarks of immune activation and immune 
      senescence, respectively, was performed for all patients. RESULTS: Reduced 
      protective humoral immunity and cellular immunity to routine childhood vaccines was 
      observed in late-treated patients. Moreover, we found that timing of HAART related 
      with the frequencies of mature activated and double negative. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Altogether the data presented in this follow-up study reenforce the importance for 
      an early start of HAART in HIV-1 vertically infected individuals and suggest that 
      timing of HAART is a fundamental factor to take into account for vaccination design 
      in this population.

TI  - BAFF and BAFF receptor levels correlate with B cell subset activation and 
      redistribution in controlled human malaria infection.
PG  - 3719-29
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1302960 [doi]
AB  - Characteristic features of Plasmodium falciparum malaria are polyclonal B cell 
      activation and an altered composition of the blood B cell compartment, including 
      expansion of CD21(-)CD27(-) atypical memory B cells. BAFF is a key cytokine in B 
      cell homeostasis, but its potential contribution to the modulation of the blood B 
      cell pool during malaria remains elusive. In the controlled human malaria model 
      (CHMI) in malaria-naive Dutch volunteers, we therefore examined the dynamics of BAFF 
      induction and B cell subset activation and composition, to investigate whether these 
      changes are linked to malaria-induced immune activation and, in particular, 
      induction of BAFF. Alterations in B cell composition after CHMI closely resembled 
      those observed in endemic areas. We further found distinct kinetics of proliferation 
      for individual B cell subsets across all developmental stages. Proliferation peaked 
      either immediately after blood-stage infection or at convalescence, and for most 
      subsets was directly associated with the peak parasitemia. Concomitantly, plasma 
      BAFF levels during CHMI were increased and correlated with membrane-expressed BAFF 
      on monocytes and dendritic cells, as well as blood-stage parasitemia and 
      parasite-induced IFN-γ. Correlating with increased plasma BAFF and IFN-γ levels, 
      IgD(-)CD38(low)CD21(-)CD27(-) atypical B cells showed the strongest proliferative 
      response of all memory B cell subsets. This provides unique evidence for a link 
      between malaria-induced immune activation and temporary expansion of this B cell 
      subset. Finally, baseline BAFF-R levels before CHMI were predictive of subsequent 
      changes in proportions of individual B cell subsets. These findings suggest an 
      important role of BAFF in facilitating B cell subset proliferation and 
      redistribution as a consequence of malaria-induced immune activation.

AB  - There is a paucity of species-specific antibodies available for feline 
      haematopoietic conditions. The purpose of this study was to broaden the panel of 
      antibodies available for use in the immunophenotypic characterisation of feline 
      haematopoietic cells by testing clones of anti-human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on 
      normal, neoplastic and cultured feline haematopoietic progenitors to determine 
      cross-reactivity to feline counterparts. In this study, 24 clones of anti-human mAbs 
      were tested on normal or neoplastic feline bone marrow and peripheral blood cells. 
      Six of these mAbs, including anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)61, anti-CD18, 
      anti-CD14, anti-CD235a, anti-CD41 and anti-CD29, cross-reacted with normal feline 
      bone marrow cells, whereas anti-CD33 and anti-CD117 cross-reacted with the blast 
      cells in the bone marrow of two cats with myelodysplastic syndrome, and anti-CD71, 
      anti-235a, anti-41 and anti-42 cross-reacted with immature erythroid cells in a cat 
      with erythroleukaemia. In a feline immunodeficiency virus-positive cat, bone marrow 
      cells were labelled with anti-CD33, anti-14 and anti-45. Anti-CD18, anti-CD14, 
      anti-CD41 and anti-CD61 also reacted with the peripheral blood cells of the healthy 
      cats. The feline haematopoietic progenitors formed colonies in the 
      methylcellulose-based semisolid medium with significant enrichment of colony-forming 
      unit-granulocyte, monocyte and burst-forming unit-erythroid. A panel of six 
      anti-feline mAbs (anti-CD21-like, anti-T lymphocytes, anti-CD172a, anti-granulocyte, 
      anti-CD45-like and anti-CD18) and eight anti-human antibodies (anti-CD71, anti-CD33, 
      anti-CD235a, anti-CD41, anti-CD61, anti-CD117, anti-CD38 and anti-CD34) were used 
      for the immunophenotypic characterisation of the feline bone marrow progenitors. 
      CD45, CD33, CD235a and CD18 were expressed by the feline haematopoietic progenitor 
      cells, with the highest expression level for CD45.

      killed by anti-Fc receptor-like 5 immunotoxins in hepatitis C virus-associated mixed 
      cryoglobulinemia vasculitis.
PG  - 433-43

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is associated with B cell lymphoproliferative 
      disorders, including mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) vasculitis and B cell non-Hodgkin's 
      lymphoma. The expansion of clonal and autoreactive rheumatoid factor-bearing 
      CD21(-/low) marginal zone (MZ) B cells was demonstrated in patients with 
      HCV-associated MC vasculitis. Fc receptor-like (FCRL) proteins comprise a family of 
      immunoregulatory proteins preferentially expressed on B lineage cells. The goal of 
      this study was to investigate the expression of FCRL proteins 1-5 on B cells from 
      patients with HCV-associated MC vasculitis. METHODS: Expression of FCRL proteins 1-5 
      was assessed by flow cytometry on B cells from 15 HCV-infected patients with type II 
      MC (7 of whom had B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), 20 HCV-infected patients without 
      MC, and 20 healthy donors. To evaluate FCRL-5 as an immunotherapy target in 
      HCV-associated MC vasculitis, 2 anti-FCRL-5 recombinant immunotoxins were produced 
      using anti-FCRL-5 monoclonal antibodies and Pseudomonas exotoxin. RESULTS: 
      Expression of FCRLs 2, 3, and 5 was markedly increased while expression of FCRL-1 
      was decreased on clonal CD21(-/low) MZ B cells, as compared with other B cell 
      subsets, from HCV-infected patients and healthy donors. However, there was no 
      difference in the pattern of FCRL expression between HCV-MC patients with lymphoma 
      and those without lymphoma. The anti-FCRL-5 immunotoxins showed specific 
      cytotoxicity against FCRL-5-expressing clonal CD21(-/low) MZ B cells isolated from 
      HCV-infected patients as well as FCRL-5-transfected cell lines. No cytotoxicity 
      against T cells or conventional B cells was observed. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      suggest that FCRL-5-targeting therapies could be a specific treatment for 
      HCV-associated MC vasculitis and other FCRL-5-positive autoimmune B cell disorders.

AB  - Hepatitis C cirrhosis is associated with a profound disappearance of memory B-cells. 
      We sought to determine if this loss is associated with the expansion of the 
      CD27(-)CD21(-) tissue-like memory B-cells with features of B-cell exhaustion. To 
      this end, we quantified the frequency of CD27(-)CD21(-) B-cells in healthy, 
      non-cirrhotic HCV-infected, and cirrhotic patients. We examined the expression of 
      putative inhibitory receptors, the proliferative and immunoglobulin-secreting 
      capacity of CD27/CD21-defined B-cell subsets upon B-cell receptor and/or CD40 
      stimulation. We found that CD27(-)CD21(-) B-cells are significantly increased in 
      frequency relative to healthy donors in HCV-infected patients. CD27(-)CD21(-) 
      B-cells were hypoproliferative relative to naïve and resting memory B-cells upon 
      agonistic stimulation, but retained similar capacity for antibody secretion. 
      CONCLUSION: CD27(-)CD21(-) tissue-like memory B-cells with exhausted proliferation 
      circulate at increased frequency in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic HCV-infected 
      patients. This B-cell subset does not appear anergic, exhibiting 
      immunoglobulin-secreting capacity on CD40 agonism indistinguishable from other 
      CD27/CD21-defined B-cell subsets.

AB  - Dysregulation of T-cell survival and apoptosis is the common cause of autoimmune 
      diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the factors inducing imbalance of 
      T-cell survival and apoptosis in MS remains unclear. Here, we show that the 
      resistance to apoptosis was associated with high levels of B-cell activating factor 
      (BAFF). Blockade of BAFF with TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium modulator 
      and cyclophilin ligand interactor)-IgG significantly reduced T-cell survival in 
      myelin oligodendroglia glycoprotein (MOG)-induced chronic experimental allergic 
      encephalitis (EAE). Furthermore, BAFF induced anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl2 
      expression in T cells by up-regulating osteopontin (OPN) secretion from B cells. 
      BAFF mainly induced OPN expression in splenic CD21(-)CD23(+) B cells via a NF-kB 
      dependent signaling pathway. In addition, we found that BAFF and OPN levels were 
      increased in MS patients similar to the results obtained from our mice research. The 
      study suggests that BAFF regulates T-cell survival by inducing OPN secretion in B 
      cells in autoimmune diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize baseline canine lymphocyte phenotypes including 
      lymphocytes coexpressing multiple markers by novel 7-color multiparameter flow 
      cytometry. STUDY DESIGN: Fresh canine peripheral blood lymphocytes of 79 healthy 
      26-week-old Beagle or Beagle-mix dogs were stained and analyzed. RESULTS: The high 
      number of samples and acquired flow data (averaging 1.9 x 10(5) cells/sample) 
      allowed the detection of minor lymphocyte subsets coexpressing multiple lymphocyte 
      markers. The averaged percentages of major lymphocyte subsets of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, 
      CD21+ and gammadelta TCR+ cells from this study were 74.0, 43.6, 14.3, 9.6, and 0.2, 
      respectively, which were comparable but uniquely different from other reports as 
      they were simultaneously detected in the same sample. We demonstrated that the 
      commonly used CD21 and CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) clones, previously recommended 
      not to be used in the same staining, could and should be used together with the 
      proper steps of lymphocyte gating. We found a high percentage (10.3%) of 
      unidentified CD21- CD3+ CD4- CD8-gammadelta TCR- lymphocyte subset that has never 
      been reported. The intensive gating strategy and the mean percentages of each 
      lymphocyte subset to their parent subsets and to the total lymphocyte population are 
      presented and discussed. CONCLUSION: The canine lymphocyte phenotypes were fully 
      characterized. This novel multiparameter flow cytometry method is a powerful 
      approach to in-crease the accuracy of lymphocyte phenotyping in dogs.

AB  - Here we demonstrate a unique case of CD20-negative low-grade B cell lymphoma showing 
      immunophenotypic and genotypic features resembling multiple myeloma. The female 
      patient had no abnormal masses, splenomegaly, swelled lymph nodes, or bone lesions. 
      Although serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were decreased without M protein, κ-type 
      Bence-Jones protein was observed. In bone marrow, monotonous proliferation of small 
      to medium-sized lymphoid cells was observed without classical myeloma cells, the 
      same histological findings as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The cells were CD38+, 
      CD138+, CD43+, CD44+, CD3-, CD4-, CD5-, CD7-, CD8-, CD10-, CD11b-, CD19-, CD20-, 
      CD21-, CD23-, CD24-, CD25-, CD27-, CD40-, CD45-, and CD56-. Surface or cytoplasmic 
      IgM, κ, or λ were all negative. Chromosomal analysis demonstrated t(11;14)(q13;q32). 
      The present case may belong to a new entity of low-grade B cell lymphoma with the 
      same histological findings as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, mainly proliferated in 
      bone marrow whose immunophenotype and genotype are similar to plasma cell myeloma.

AB  - Clinical immunity to malaria declines in the absence of repeated parasite exposure. 
      However, little is known about how B cell populations and antigen-specific memory B 
      cells change in the absence of P. falciparum infection. A successful indoor residual 
      insecticide spraying campaign in a highland area of western Kenya, led to an absence 
      of blood-stage P. falciparum infection between March 2007 and April 2008. We 
      assessed memory B cell responses in 45 adults at the beginning (April 2008) and end 
      (April 2009) of a subsequent 12-month period during which none of the adults had 
      evidence of asymptomatic parasitemia or clinical disease. Antibodies and memory B 
      cells to the 42-kDa portion of the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-142) were 
      measured using ELISA and ELISPOT assays, respectively. B cell populations were 
      characterized by flow cytometry. From 2008 to 2009, the prevalence of 
      MSP-142-specific memory B cells (45% vs. 55%, respectively, P = 0.32) or antibodies 
      (91% vs. 82%, respectively, P = 0.32) did not differ significantly, although 
      specific individuals did change from positive to negative and vice versa, 
      particularly for memory B cells, suggesting possible low-level undetected 
      parasitemia may have occurred in some individuals. The magnitude of MSP-142-specific 
      memory B cells and levels of antibodies to MSP-142 also did not differ from 2008 to 
      2009 (P>0.10 for both). However, from 2008 to 2009 the proportions of both 
      class-switched atypical (CD19+IgD-CD27-CD21-IgM-) and class-switched activated 
      (CD19+IgD-CD27+CD21-IgM-) memory B cells decreased (both P<0.001). In contrast, 
      class-switched resting classical memory B cells (CD19+IgD-CD27+CD21+IgM-) increased 
      (P<0.001). In this area of seasonal malaria transmission, a one- year absence of 
      detectable P. falciparum infection was not associated with changes in the prevalence 
      or level of MSP-142 specific memory B cells, but was associated with major changes 
      in overall memory B cell subsets.

AB  - Canine NK cells still are not well-characterized due to the lack of information 
      concerning specific NK cell markers and the fact that NK cells are not an abundant 
      cell population. In this study, we selectively expanded the canine cytotoxic large 
      granular lymphocytes (CLGLs) that exhibit morphologic, genetic, and functional 
      characteristics of NK cells from normal donor PBMCs. The cultured CLGLs were 
      characterized by a high proportion of CD5(dim) expressing cells, of which the 
      majority of cells co-expressed CD3 and CD8, but did not express TCRαβ and TCRγδ. The 
      phenotype of the majority of the CLGLs was CD5(dim)CD3(+)CD8(+) 
      TCRαβ(-)TCRγδ(-)CD4(-)CD21(-)CD11c(+/-)CD11d(+/-)CD44(+). The expression of mRNAs 
      for NK cell-associated receptors (NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, Ly49, perforin, and granzyme 
      B) were highly upregulated in cultured CLGLs. Specifically, NKp46 was remarkably 
      upregulated in the cultured CLGLs compared to PBMCs. The mRNAs for the 
      NKT-associated iTCRα gene in CLGLs was present at a basal level. The cytotoxic 
      activity of the CLGLs against canine NK cell-sensitive CTAC cells was remarkably 
      elevated in a dose-dependent manner, and the CLGLs produced large amounts of IFN-γ. 
      The antitumor activity of CLGLs extended to different types of canine tumor cells 
      (CF41.Mg and K9TCC-pu-AXC) without specific antigen recognition. These results are 
      consistent with prior reports, and strongly suggest that the selectively expanded 
      CLGLs represent a population of canine NK cells. The results of this study will 
      contribute to future research on canine NK cells as well as NK cell-based 
      immunotherapy.

TI  - [Solid solitary hamartoma of the spleen].
PG  - 380-3
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hamartoma of the spleen is a rare, sometimes asymptomatic similar to 
      hemangioma benign tumor of the spleen, which, owing to the new diagnostic imaging 
      methods, is discovered with increasing frequency. It appears as solitary or multiple 
      tumorous lesions. CASE OUTLINE: We present a 48-year-old woman in whom, during the 
      investigation for Helicobacter pylori gastric infection and rectal bleeding, with 
      ultrasonography, a mass 6.5x6.5 cm in diameter was discovered by chance within the 
      spleen. Splenectomy was performed due to suspected lymphoma of the spleen. On 
      histology, tumor showed to be of mixed cellular structure, with areas without white 
      pulp, at places with marked dilatation of sinusoids and capillaries to the formation 
      of "blood lakes" between which broad hypercellular Billroth's zones were present. 
      Extramedullary hematopoiesis was found focally. The cells that covered vascular 
      spaces were CD34+ and CD31+ and CD8- and CD21-. CONCLUSION: Hamartoma has to be 
      taken into consideration always when well circumscribed hypervascular tumor within 
      the spleen is found, particularly in children. Although the diagnosis of hamartoma 
      may be suspected preoperatively, the exact diagnosis is established based on 
      histological and immunohystochemistry examinations. Treatment is most often 
      splenectomy and rarely a partial splenectomy is possible, which is recommended 
      particularly in children.

AB  - Autoantibodies to diverse antigens escape regulation in systemic lupus erythematosus 
      under the influence of a multitude of predisposing genes. To gain insight into the 
      differential impact of diverse genetic backgrounds on tolerance mechanisms 
      controlling autoantibody production in lupus, we established a single lupus-derived 
      nephritis associated anti-basement membrane Ig transgene on each of four inbred 
      murine lupus strains, including BXSB, (NZBxNZW)F1, NZB, and MRL/lpr, as approved by 
      the Duke University and the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Centers' Animal Care and 
      Use Committees. In nonautoimmune C57BL/6 mice, B cells bearing this anti-laminin Ig 
      transgene are stringently regulated by central deletion, editing, and anergy. Here, 
      we show that tolerance is generally intact in unmanipulated Ig transgenic BXSB, 
      (NZBxNZW)F1, and NZB mice, based on absence of serum transgenic anti-laminin 
      autoantibodies and failure to recover spontaneous anti-laminin monoclonal 
      antibodies. Four- to six-fold depletion of splenic B cells in transgenic mice of 
      these strains, as well as in MRL/lpr transgenic mice, and reduced frequency of IgM+ 
      bone marrow B cells suggest that central deletion is grossly intact. Nonetheless the 
      4 strains demonstrate distinct transgenic B cell phenotypes, including 
      endotoxin-stimulated production of anti-laminin antibodies by B cells from 
      transgenic NZB mice, and in vitro hyperproliferation of both endotoxin- and 
      BCR-stimulated B cells from transgenic BXSB mice, which are shown to have an 
      enrichment of CD21-high marginal zone cells. Rare anti-laminin transgenic B cells 
      spontaneously escape tolerance in MRL/lpr mice. Further study of the mechanisms 
      underlying these strain-specific B cell fates will provide insight into genetic 
      modification of humoral autoimmunity in lupus.

TI  - Expansion of autoreactive unresponsive CD21-/low B cells in Sjögren's 
      syndrome-associated lymphoproliferation.
PG  - 1085-96
LID - 10.1002/art.37828 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease associated with 
      a high risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study was undertaken to 
      determine the nature of B cells driving lymphoproliferation in primary SS. METHODS: 
      B cell subsets and function were analyzed in peripheral blood from 66 adult patients 
      with primary SS (including 14 patients with B cell lymphoproliferative disease 
      [LPD]) and 30 healthy donors, using flow cytometry, calcium mobilization, and gene 
      array analysis. The reactivity of recombinant antibodies isolated from single B 
      cells from patients with primary SS and LPD was tested using an enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: We observed an expansion of an unusual CD21-/low B 
      cell population that correlated with lymphoproliferation in patients with primary 
      SS. A majority of CD21-/low B cells from patients with primary SS expressed 
      autoreactive antibodies, which recognized nuclear and cytoplasmic structures. These 
      B cells belonged to the memory compartment, since their Ig genes were mutated. They 
      were unable to induce calcium flux, become activated, or proliferate in response to 
      B cell receptor and/or CD40 triggering, suggesting that these autoreactive B cells 
      may be anergic. However, CD21-/low B cells from patients with primary SS remained 
      responsive to Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Molecules specifically expressed 
      in CD21-/low B cells that are likely to induce their unresponsive stage were 
      detected in gene array analyses. CONCLUSION: Patients with primary SS who display 
      high frequencies of autoreactive and unresponsive CD21-/low B cells are susceptible 
      to developing lymphoproliferation. These cells remain in peripheral blood controlled 
      by functional anergy instead of being eliminated, and chronic antigenic stimulation 
      through TLR stimulation may create a favorable environment for breaking tolerance 
      and activating these cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We have recently investigated the localisation of 
      immunoglobulin-producing cells (IPCs) in inflamed intestinal tissue samples from 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and identified two main patterns of 
      B lymphocyte infiltration: one characterised by the moderate strong stromal 
      localisation of small B1 cell-like IgM+/CD79+/CD20-/CD21-/CD23-/CD5 ± IPCs, and the 
      other by the peri-glandular localisation of IPCs with irregular nuclei that had 
      surface markers specific for a B cell subset (IgM and CD79), but quantitative 
      differences in their λ and κ chains. The same patients were also tested for CD15+ 
      receptors, which were localised on inflammatory cell surfaces or in the crypts of 
      the intestinal epithelium. CD15+ receptor distribution in inflamed tissues was 
      limited to the cell structures. The aim of the study was to analyse variations in 
      IPCs and CD15+ cell morphology or distribution in bowel biopsy specimens taken from 
      patients with pre-malignant polyps or adenocarcinomas. METHODS: IPCs were analysed 
      by means of immunofluorescence using polyclonal goat anti-human μ chains. The 
      pre-malignant polyp specimens were tested for B cell surface phenotype λ and κ 
      chains, CD79, CD20, CD21 and CD23 using an immunoperoxidase method. CD15+ cells were 
      evaluated using the immunoperoxidase method and monoclonal anti-CD15 IgM. RESULTS: 
      The study involved 14 patients (four with pre-malignant polyps and 10 with 
      colorectal adenocarcinomas). The distribution of μ chains and CD15 markers varied in 
      all of the biopsies, but delineated normal cell structures in the pre-malignant 
      polyp specimens. B cell surface phenotype analysis of μ chain-positive cells 
      identified a subset of CD79+/CD20-/CD21-/CD23- IPCs. The IPCs in certain areas 
      showed the sporadic disintegration of inflammatory cell membranes or the 
      accumulation of fluorescence in individual cells. IPC membrane disintegration was 
      particularly marked in all of the adenocarcinoma samples, in which the CD15 markers 
      also showed epithelial cell involvement. Furthermore, six of the ten adenocarcinoma 
      samples had atypical and reorganised membranes that expressed an excess of both 
      receptors and isolated small portions of tissue within the tumour. CONCLUSION: The 
      findings of this preliminary morphological study suggest the presence of membrane 
      disintegration and remodelling mechanisms in the tumours. The newly-formed membranes 
      expressed high concentrations of inflammatory cell receptors that can confer 
      adhesive properties.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus associated with lymphomas and carcinomas. 
      While EBV-associated epithelial cell lines are good model systems to investigate the 
      role of EBV in carcinoma, only a few cell lines are available as they are hard to 
      acquire. A greater variety of naturally EBV-infected cell lines which are derived 
      from tumour patients are needed to represent various features of EBVaGC. We 
      characterized cell line YCCEL1, established from a Korean EBVaGC patient, to 
      ascertain whether it can be used to study the roles of EBV in EBVaGC. The expression 
      of EBV genes and cell surface markers was examined by in situ hybridization, RT-PCR, 
      Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence assay and Northern blot analysis. EBV 
      episomal status was analysed by Southern blotting and real-time PCR. This cell line 
      expressed EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A), but 
      not EBNA2, LMP2B nor LMP1. The majority of the lytic proteins were not detected in 
      YCCEL1 cells either before or after treatment with 
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. YCCEL1 cells expressed BART microRNAs (miRNAs) 
      at high level but did not express BHRF1 miRNAs. YCCEL1 cells expressed cytokeratin, 
      but not CD21 and CD19, suggesting CD21-independent EBV infection. The latent EBV 
      gene and EBV miRNA expression pattern of YCCEL1 cells closely resembled that of 
      general EBVaGC cases. Our results support the value of YCCEL1 cells as a good model 
      system to study the role of EBV in gastric carcinogenesis.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) attachment to primary B cells initiates virus entry. 
      Although CD21 is the only known receptor for EBVgp350/220, a recent report documents 
      EBV-infected B cells from a patient genetically deficient in CD21. On normal resting 
      B cells, CD21 forms two membrane complexes: one with CD19 and another with CD35. 
      Whereas the CD21/CD19 complex is widely retained on immortalized and B cell tumor 
      lines, the related complement-regulatory protein CD35 is lost. To determine the 
      role(s) of CD35 in initial infection, we transduced a CD21-negative pre-B cell and 
      myeloid leukemia line with CD35, CD21, or both. Cells expressing CD35 alone bound 
      gp350/220 and became latently infected when the fusion receptor HLA II was 
      coexpressed. Temporal, biophysical, and structural characteristics of CD35-mediated 
      infection were distinct from CD21. Identification of CD35 as an EBV receptor 
      uncovers a salient role in primary infection, addresses unsettled questions of virus 
      tropism, and underscores the importance of EBVgp350/220 for vaccine development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze CD21 expression in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 
      to explore its relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics and 
      prognosis. METHODS: The clinical data from 80 DLBCL patients who were treated in 
      First Hospital of Jilin University from June 2005 to September 2011 were 
      retrospectively analyzed. The cases were subjected to immunohistochemical staining 
      (SP method) for Ki-67, CD20, CD79a, CD3, CD43, CD5, cyclin D1, bcl-2, CD10, bcl-6, 
      GCET-1, FOXP-1 and MUM-1 protein expression in the tumor tissue. 
      Immunohistochemistry was also used to detect CD21 expression in the tumor tissue. 
      SPSS 18.0 was used to analyze the relationship between CD21 expression and various 
      clinical factors, and the relationship between various clinical factors including 
      CD21 and overall survival. RESULTS: In the patients aged under 60 years, the 
      incidence of CD21(+) lymphoma (64.0%, 16/25) was significantly higher than that of 
      CD21(-) lymphoma (38.2%, 21/55). There were more CD21(+) lymphoma patients who were 
      at clinical stages I-II (52.0%, 13/25) than patients with CD21(-)lymphomas (23.6%, 
      13/55). There were also more CD21(+) lymphoma patients (68.0%, 17/25) having less 
      than two extranodal sites involvement than CD21(-)lymphoma patients (41.8%, 23/55). 
      In addition, there were more CD21(+) lymphoma patients with IPI 0-2 (68.0%, 17/25) 
      than CD21(-)lymphoma patients (41.8%, 23/55). There were more CD21(+) lymphoma 
      patients with GCB subtype (60.0%, 15/25) than CD21(-)lymphoma patients (23.6%, 
      13/55). Death related to DLBCL was less in CD21(+) lymphoma patients (32.0%, 8/25) 
      than CD21(-) lymphoma patients (56.4%, 31/55). Univariate analysis showed that these 
      clinical pathological characteristics affected the overall survival of DLBCL 
      patients, including age, ECOG score, LDH, extranodal involvement, IPI index, CD21 
      expression, treatment option and efficacy (P < 0.05) . Cox multivariate analysis 
      showed that ECOG score, LDH, extranodal involvement, CD21 expression were closely 
      related to prognosis, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). 
      Among the 80 patients, the overall survival (OS) of CD21(+) lymphoma patients was 
      significantly higher than that of CD21(-) lymphoma patients. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      expression of CD21 is associated with young age at onset, early clinical stage, 
      small number of involvement and low IPI index. The OS and median overall survival of 
      CD21(+) lymphoma patients are significantly higher than those of CD21(-) patients. 
      CD21 expression, ECOG score, LDH, extranodal involvement are independent prognostic 
      factors in DLBCL, and in particular, the expression of CD21 is more significant in 
      the prognosis of DLBCL patients.

TI  - Characterization of the gastric immune response in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) with 
      Helicobacter-associated gastritis.
PG  - 824-33
LID - 10.1177/0300985811412620 [doi]
AB  - Captive cheetahs have an unusually severe progressive gastritis that is not present 
      in wild cheetahs infected with the same strains of Helicobacter. This gastritis, 
      when severe, has florid lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates in the epithelium and 
      lamina propria with gland destruction, parietal cell loss, and, in some cases, 
      lymphoid follicles. The local gastric immune response was characterized by 
      immunohistochemistry in 21 cheetahs with varying degrees of gastritis. The character 
      of the response was similar among types of gastritis except that cheetahs with 
      severe gastritis had increased numbers (up to 70%) of lamina proprial CD79a+CD21- B 
      cells. CD3+CD4+ T cells were present in the lamina propria, and CD3+CD8α+ T cells 
      were within the glandular epithelium. Lymphoid aggregates had follicular 
      differentiation with a central core of CD79a+/CD45R+ B cells and with an outer zone 
      of CD3+ T cells that expressed both CD4 and CD8 antigens. MHC II antigens were 
      diffusely expressed throughout the glandular and superficial epithelium. No cheetah 
      had evidence of autoantibodies against the gastric mucosa when gastric samples from 
      30 cheetahs with different degrees of gastritis were incubated with autologous and 
      heterologous serum. These findings indicate that T-cell distribution in cheetahs is 
      qualitatively similar to that in other species infected with Helicobacter but that 
      large numbers of lamina propria activated B cells and plasma cells did distinguish 
      cheetahs with severe gastritis. Further research is needed to determine whether 
      alterations in the Th1:Th2 balance are the cause of this more plasmacytic response 
      in some cheetahs.

AB  - Multiparametric flow cytometry was used to compare peripheral blood lymphocyte 
      subset distribution between healthy working police Labrador Retrievers (LRs; n=12) 
      and German Shepherd dogs (GS; n=11) living in the same environment. The CD4/CD8 
      ratio was significantly higher in LR than in GS because of the lower percentage of 
      CD8+ T lymphocytes in LR. GS showed the highest relative percentage of CD3-/CD21- 
      lymphocytes, whereas LR had the highest percentages of MHC II+ lymphocytes. Because 
      age, sex, environmental and housing conditions, dietary patterns, and training or 
      working routines were similar in both breeds in the study, differences in peripheral 
      blood lymphocyte subset distribution could be attributed to the influence of breed 
      on the immune system.

AB  - CD23(+)CD21(high)CD1d(high) B cells in inflamed nodes (Bin cells) accumulate in the 
      lymph nodes (LNs) draining inflamed joints of the TNF-α-transgenic mouse model of 
      rheumatoid arthritis and are primarily involved in the significant histological and 
      functional LN alterations that accompany disease exacerbation in this strain. In 
      this study, we investigate the origin and function of Bin cells. We show that 
      adoptively transferred GFP(+) sorted mature follicular B (FoB) cells home 
      preferentially to inflamed LNs of TNF-α-transgenic mice where they rapidly 
      differentiate into Bin cells, with a close correlation with the endogenous Bin 
      fraction. Bin cells are also induced in wild-type LNs after immunization with 
      T-dependent Ags and display a germinal center phenotype at higher rates compared 
      with FoB cells. Furthermore, we show that Bin cells can capture and process 
      Ag-immune complexes in a CD21-dependent manner more efficiently than can FoB cells, 
      and they express greater levels of MHC class II and costimulatory Ags CD80 and CD86. 
      We propose that Bin cells are a previously unrecognized inflammation-induced B cell 
      population with increased Ag capture and activation potential, which may facilitate 
      normal immune responses but may contribute to autoimmunity when chronic inflammation 
      causes their accumulation and persistence in affected LNs.

TI  - Decreasing the configurational entropy and the hydrophobicity of EBV-derived peptide 
      11389 increased its antigenicity, immunogenicity and its ability of inducing IL-6.
PG  - 2165-75
LID - 10.1007/s00726-011-0954-7 [doi]
AB  - Peptide 11389 from CD21-binding region of EBV-gp350/220 protein binds to PBMCs 
      inducing IL-6 expression and inhibiting EBV-binding to PBMCs. In addition, 
      anti-peptide 11389 antibodies recognize EBV-infected cells and inhibit both EBV 
      infection and IL-6 production in PBMCs. We have postulated that native structure 
      stabilization of peptide 11389 sequence can increase its biological activity. The 
      strategy was to modify its sequence to restrict the number of structures that 
      peptide 11389 could acquire in solution (decreasing peptide's configurational 
      entropy) and to weaken the non-relevant intermolecular interactions (decreasing its 
      hydrophobicity), preserving CD21-interacting residues and structure as displayed in 
      the native protein. Thirteen analog peptides were designed and synthesized; most of 
      them were monomers containing an intra-chain disulfide bridge. Analog peptides 
      34058, 34060, 34061, 34296, 34298, 34299 and 34300 inhibited EBV invasion of PBMCs. 
      Peptides 34059, 34060, 34295 and 34297 induced IL-6 levels in PBMCs (EC50=3.4, 3.3, 
      0.5, 0.5 μM, respectively) at higher potency than peptide 11389 (EC50=5.8 μM). 
      Peptides 34057, 34059, 34060, 34301 and 34302 interacted with anti-EBV antibodies 
      with affinities from 3 to 50 times higher than peptide 11389. Most of analog 
      peptides were highly immunogenic and elicited antibodies that cross-react with EBV. 
      In conclusion, we have designed peptides displaying higher biological activity than 
      peptide 11389.

TI  - Genetic CD21 deficiency is associated with hypogammaglobulinemia.
PG  - 801-810.e6
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2011.09.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21) is part of the B-cell coreceptor and 
      expressed by mature B cells and follicular dendritic cells. CD21 is a receptor for 
      C3d-opsonized immune complexes and enhances antigen-specific B-cell responses. 
      OBJECTIVE: Genetic inactivation of the murine CR2 locus results in impaired humoral 
      immune responses. Here we report the first case of a genetic CD21 deficiency in 
      human subjects. METHODS: CD21 protein expression was analyzed by means of flow 
      cytometry and Western blotting. CD21 transcripts were quantified by using real-time 
      PCR. The CD21 gene was sequenced. Wild-type and mutant CD21 cDNA expression was 
      studied after transfection of 293T cells. Binding of EBV-gp350 or C3d-containing 
      immune complexes and induction of calcium flux in CD21-deficient B cells were 
      analyzed by means of flow cytometry. Antibody responses to protein and 
      polysaccharide vaccines were measured. RESULTS: A 28-year-old man presented with 
      recurrent infections, reduced class-switched memory B cells, and 
      hypogammaglobulinemia. CD21 receptor expression was undetectable. Binding of 
      C3d-containing immune complexes and EBV-gp350 to B cells was severely reduced. 
      Sequence analysis revealed a compound heterozygous deleterious mutation in the CD21 
      gene. Functional studies with anti-immunoglobulin- and C3d-containing immune 
      complexes showed a complete loss of costimulatory activity of C3d in enhancing 
      suboptimal B-cell receptor stimulation. Vaccination responses to protein antigens 
      were normal, but the response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination was 
      moderately impaired. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic CD21 deficiency adds to the molecular 
      defects observed in human subjects with hypogammaglobulinemia.

TI  - Comparative study of the plasma globulin level, CD21(-) B-cell counts and FOXP3 mRNA 
      expression level in CD4(+) T-cells for different clinical stages of feline 
      immunodeficiency virus infected cats.
PG  - 157-61
LID - 10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.10.022 [doi]
AB  - Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection leads to hypergammaglobulinemia 
      through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. We investigated changes in plasma 
      globulin level, B cells, and T cells with progression of the clinical stage of 
      FIV-infected cats. We classified FIV-infected cats into the stage of Asymptomatic 
      carrier (AC) and AIDS-related complex (ARC) based on the clinical symptoms, and 
      measured the plasma globulin level, the CD4(+) T-cell counts, and analyzed surface 
      markers of B cells. We investigated the relationship between the plasma globulin 
      level and regulatory T cells (Tregs) using the Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) mRNA 
      expression level. In FIV-infected cats, the plasma globulin level and the surface 
      immunoglobulin (sIg)(+) CD21(-) B-cell counts were increased, whereas the CD4(+) 
      T-cell counts were decreased compared with specific-pathogen free (SPF) cats. The 
      mRNA expression of Blimp-1 (master gene of plasma cells) was increased in peripheral 
      blood, and the FOXP3 mRNA expression level was decreased in CD4(+) T-cells. These 
      immunological changes were marked in the ARC stage. These data indicate that the 
      decrease of Tregs and the increase of plasma cells lead to hypergammaglobulinemia.

TI  - Immune function in female B(6)C(3)F(1) mice is modulated by DE-71, a commercial 
      polybrominated diphenyl ether mixture.
PG  - 96-107
LID - 10.3109/1547691X.2011.643418 [doi]
AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are an important class of flame-retardants 
      that are environmentally persistent and bioaccumulative. Toxicity of these compounds 
      has become a concern because detectable levels of PBDEs are present in humans and 
      wildlife and they are structurally similar to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This 
      study examined the effects of the commercial penta-BDE mixture, DE-71, in adult 
      female B(6)C(3)F(1) mice on hematology, serum clinical chemistry, thyroid hormones, 
      tissue histology, and several immunotoxicity end-points (lymphocyte proliferation, 
      NK cell activity, splenic immunophenotypes, and SRBC-specific-IgM production). Mice 
      were exposed via oral gavage for 28 days to achieve total administered doses (TAD) 
      of 0, 0.5, 5, 50, or 100 mg/kg. No changes in histology, clinical chemistry, body or 
      organ weights were observed. Serum total T3 and T4 levels were not altered by any of 
      the DE-71 treatments. Peripheral blood monocyte numbers were decreased by the 0.5, 
      5, and 50 mg/kg treatments, but not by the 100 mg/kg TAD concentration. Compared to 
      controls, mitogen-stimulated T- and B-cell proliferation was increased by the 100 
      mg/kg TAD concentration (ED(50) = 60 mg/kg TAD [2.14 mg/kg/day] and 58 mg/kg TAD 
      [2.57 mg/kg/day], respectively). NK cell activity was decreased compared to controls 
      by the 100 mg/kg TAD concentration (ED(50) = 20 mg/kg TAD [0.7 mg/kg/day]). No 
      alterations were noted in thymic T-cell populations or in SRBC-specific-IgM 
      production. Numbers of CD19(+)CD21(-), CD19(+)CD21(+), CD4(+)CD8(-), CD4(-)CD8(+), 
      CD4(-)CD8(-), and MHC-II(+) cells in the spleen were not affected. However, the 
      numbers of splenic CD4(+)CD8(+) cells were decreased compared to the controls by 
      0.5, 5, and 100 mg/kg TAD. This study provides an assessment of the systemic 
      toxicity and immunotoxicity of DE-71, and indicates that immune parameters are 
      modulated at exposure concentrations lower than previously reported.

TI  - B lymphocyte intestinal homing in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/1471-2172-12-71 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is thought to be due to an abnormal 
      interaction between the host immune system and commensal microflora. Within the 
      intestinal immune system, B cells produce physiologically natural antibodies but 
      pathologically atypical anti-neutrophil antibodies (xANCAs) are frequently observed 
      in patients with IBD. The objective is to investigate the localisation of 
      immunoglobulin-producing cells (IPCs) in samples of inflamed intestinal tissue taken 
      from patients with IBD, and their possible relationship with clinical features. 
      METHODS: The IPCs in small intestinal, colonic and rectal biopsy specimens of 
      patients with IBD were analysed by means of immunofluorescence using polyclonal 
      rabbit anti-human Ig and goat anti-human IgM. The B cell phenotype of the 
      IPC-positive samples was assessed using monoclonal antibodies specific for CD79, 
      CD20, CD23, CD21, CD5, λ and κ chains. Statistical correlations were sought between 
      the histological findings and clinical expression. RESULTS: The study involved 96 
      patients (64 with ulcerative colitis and 32 with Crohn's disease). Two different 
      patterns of B lymphocyte infiltrates were found in the intestinal tissue: one was 
      characterised by a strong to moderate stromal localisation of small 
      IgM+/CD79+/CD20-/CD21-/CD23-/CD5± IPCs (42.7% of cases); in the other (57.3%) no 
      such small IPCs were detected in stromal or epithelial tissues. IPCs were 
      significantly less frequent in the patients with Crohn's disease than in those with 
      ulcerative colitis (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that different 
      immunopathogenetic pathways underlie chronic intestinal inflammation with different 
      clinical expressions. The presence of small B lymphocytes resembling B-1 cells also 
      seemed to be negatively associated with Crohn's disease. It can therefore be 
      inferred that the gut contains an alternative population of B cells that have a 
      regulatory function.

TI  - Expansion of functionally anergic CD21-/low marginal zone-like B cell clones in 
      hepatitis C virus infection-related autoimmunity.

AB  - Homeostasis of peripheral B cell subsets is disturbed during chronic hepatitis C 
      virus (HCV) infection, leading to the occurrence of autoimmunity and B cell 
      lymphoproliferation. However, mechanisms by which HCV causes lymphoproliferation 
      remain controversial. We report in this article on the elevated number of clonal 
      CD21(-/low)IgM(+)CD27(+) marginal zone (MZ)-like B cells, which correlates with 
      autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation in HCV patients. We found an increase in 
      autoreactive BCRs using V(H)1-69 and V(H)4-34 genes in CD21(-/low) MZ B cells. 
      CD21(-/low) MZ B cells showed impaired calcium-mediated signaling, did not 
      upregulate activation markers, and did not proliferate in response to BCR 
      triggering. CD21(-/low) MZ B cells also were prone to dying faster than their 
      CD21(+) counterparts, suggesting that these B cells were anergic. CD21(-/low) MZ B 
      cells, in contrast, remained responsive to TLR9 stimulation. Gene array analyses 
      revealed the critical role of Early growth response 2 and Cbl-b in the induction of 
      anergy. Therefore, HCV patients who display high frequencies of unresponsive 
      CD21(-/low) MZ B cells are more susceptible to developing autoimmunity and/or 
      lymphoproliferation. These cells remain in peripheral blood controlled by functional 
      anergy instead of being eliminated, and chronic antigenic stimulation through TLR 
      stimulation may create a favorable environment for breaking tolerance and activating 
      these cells.

TI  - Ileal Peyer's patches are not necessary for systemic B cell development and 
      maintenance and do not contribute significantly to the overall B cell pool in swine.
PG  - 5150-61
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1101879 [doi]
AB  - Based on studies of sheep, ileal Peyer's patches (IPP) have been regarded as a type 
      of primary lymphoid tissue similar to the bursa of Fabricius in chicken. Because 
      bursectomy results in B cell deficiency, we wondered whether resection of the IPP of 
      piglets would have a similar effect. Comparison of IPP-resected, surgical shams and 
      untreated germ-free piglets, all of which were later colonized with a defined 
      commensal flora, demonstrated that resection of the IPP did not alter the level and 
      phenotype of B and T cells in lymphoid tissues and the blood 10 wk after surgery. 
      Additionally, colonization of IPP caused a shift from the fetal type of lymphocyte 
      distribution to the adult type that is characterized by prevalence of B cells, with 
      many of them representing IgA(+) switched B cells or displaying a more mature 
      CD2(-)CD21(+) and CD2(-)CD21(-) phenotype. Moreover, colonization leads to 
      appearance of effector CD4(+)CD8(+) αβ T helper and CD2(+)CD8(-) γδ T cells. 
      Comparison of germ-free with colonized pigs and experiments utilizing surgical 
      transposition of jejunal Peyer's patch into terminal ileum or construction of 
      isolated ileal loops indicated that lymphocyte development in IPP is dependent on 
      colonization. Although our studies confirmed higher mitotic and apoptotic rates in 
      IPP, they failed to identify any cell populations that resemble developing B lineage 
      cells in the bone marrow. These results indicate that porcine IPP are not required 
      for systemic B cell generation or maintenance, but they are secondary lymphoid 
      tissue that appears important in immune responses to colonizing bacteria.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus infection of polarized epithelial cells via the basolateral 
      surface by memory B cell-mediated transfer infection.
PG  - e1001338
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001338 [doi]
LID - e1001338
AB  - Epstein Barr virus (EBV) exhibits a distinct tropism for both B cells and epithelial 
      cells. The virus persists as a latent infection of memory B cells in healthy 
      individuals, but a role for infection of normal epithelial is also likely. Infection 
      of B cells is initiated by the interaction of the major EBV glycoprotein gp350 with 
      CD21 on the B cell surface. Fusion is triggered by the interaction of the EBV 
      glycoprotein, gp42 with HLA class II, and is thereafter mediated by the core fusion 
      complex, gH/gL/gp42. In contrast, direct infection of CD21-negative epithelial cells 
      is inefficient, but efficient infection can be achieved by a process called transfer 
      infection. In this study, we characterise the molecular interactions involved in the 
      three stages of transfer infection of epithelial cells: (i) CD21-mediated co-capping 
      of EBV and integrins on B cells, and activation of the adhesion molecules, (ii) 
      conjugate formation between EBV-loaded B cells and epithelial cells via the capped 
      adhesion molecules, and (iii) interaction of EBV glycoproteins with epithelial 
      cells, with subsequent fusion and uptake of virions. Infection of epithelial cells 
      required the EBV gH and gL glycoproteins, but not gp42. Using an in vitro model of 
      normal polarized epithelia, we demonstrated that polarization of the EBV receptor(s) 
      and adhesion molecules restricted transfer infection to the basolateral surface. 
      Furthermore, the adhesions between EBV-loaded B cells and the basolateral surface of 
      epithelial cells included CD11b on the B cell interacting with heparan sulphate 
      moieties of CD44v3 and LEEP-CAM on epithelial cells. Consequently, transfer 
      infection was efficiently mediated via CD11b-positive memory B cells but not by 
      CD11b-negative naïve B cells. Together, these findings have important implications 
      for understanding the mechanisms of EBV infection of normal and pre-malignant 
      epithelial cells in vivo.

TI  - Bovine plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the major source of type I interferon in 
      response to foot-and-mouth disease virus in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 4297-308
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02495-10 [doi]
AB  - Type I interferons (alpha/beta interferons [IFN-α/β]) are the main innate cytokines 
      that are able to induce a cellular antiviral state, thereby limiting viral 
      replication and disease pathology. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play a 
      crucial role in the control of viral infections, especially in response to viruses 
      that have evolved mechanisms to block the type I IFN signal transduction pathway. 
      Using density gradient separation and cell sorting, we have highly enriched a 
      population of bovine cells capable of producing high levels of biologically active 
      type I IFN. These cells represented less than 0.1% of the total lymphocyte 
      population in blood, pseudoafferent lymph, and lymph nodes. Phenotypic analysis 
      identified these cells as bovine pDCs (CD3(-) CD14(-) CD21(-) CD11c(-) NK(-) TCRδ(-) 
      CD4(+) MHC II(+) CD45RB(+) CD172a(+) CD32(+)). High levels of type I IFN were 
      generated by these cells in vitro in response to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) 
      agonist CpG and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) immune complexes. In contrast, 
      immune complexes formed with UV-inactivated FMDV or FMDV empty capsids failed to 
      elicit a type I IFN response. Depletion of CD4 cells in vivo resulted in levels of 
      type I IFN in serum early during FMDV infection that were significantly lower than 
      those for control animals. In conclusion, pDCs interacting with immune-complexed 
      virus are the major source of type I interferon production during acute FMDV 
      infection in cattle.

AB  - Detailed phenotypic characterization of B cell subpopulations is of utmost 
      importance for the diagnosis and management of humoral immunodeficiencies, as they 
      are used for classification of common variable immunodeficiencies. Since 
      age-specific reference values remain scarce in the literature, we analysed by flow 
      cytometry the proportions and absolute values of total, memory, switched memory and 
      CD21(-/low) B cells in blood samples from 168 healthy children (1 day to 18 years) 
      with special attention to the different subpopulations of CD21(low) B cells. The 
      percentages of total memory B cells and their subsets significantly increased up to 
      5-10 years. In contrast, the percentages of immature CD21(-) B cells and of immature 
      transitional CD21(low)CD38(hi) B cells decreased progressively with age, whereas the 
      percentage of CD21(low) CD38(low) B cells remained stable during childhood. Our data 
      stress the importance of age-specific reference values for the correct 
      interpretation of B cell subsets in children as a diagnostic tool in 
      immunodeficiencies.

      only acquired after years of repeated infections. The B cell biology that underlies 
      this observation is poorly understood. We previously reported that "atypical" memory 
      B cells are increased in children and adults exposed to intense Pf transmission in 
      Mali, similar to what has been observed in individuals infected with HIV. In this 
      study we examined B cell subsets of Pf -infected adults in Peru and Mali to 
      determine if Pf transmission intensity correlates with atypical memory B cell 
      expansion. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this cross-sectional study venous 
      blood was collected from adults in areas of zero (U.S., n = 10), low (Peru, n = 18) 
      and high (Mali, n = 12) Pf transmission. Adults in Peru and Mali were infected with 
      Pf at the time of blood collection. Thawed lymphocytes were analyzed by flow 
      cytometry to quantify B cell subsets, including atypical memory B cells, defined by 
      the cell surface markers CD19(+) CD20(+) CD21(-) CD27(-) CD10(-). In Peru, the mean 
      level of atypical memory B cells, as a percent of total B cells, was higher than 
      U.S. adults (Peru mean: 5.4% [95% CI: 3.61-7.28]; U.S. mean: 1.4% [95% CI: 
      0.92-1.81]; p<0.0001) but lower than Malian adults (Mali mean 13.1% [95% CI: 
      10.68-15.57]; p = 0.0001). In Peru, individuals self-reporting ≥1 prior malaria 
      episodes had a higher percentage of atypical memory B cells compared to those 
      reporting no prior episodes (≥1 prior episodes mean: 6.6% [95% CI: 4.09-9.11]; no 
      prior episodes mean: 3.1% [95% CI: 1.52-4.73]; p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Compared to Pf-naive controls, atypical memory B cells were increased in Peruvian 
      adults exposed to low Pf transmission, and further increased in Malian adults 
      exposed to intense Pf transmission. Understanding the origin, function and antigen 
      specificity of atypical memory B cells in the context of Pf infection could 
      contribute to our understanding of naturally-acquired malaria immunity.

TI  - The bovine herpesvirus 4 Bo10 gene encodes a nonessential viral envelope protein 
      that regulates viral tropism through both positive and negative effects.
PG  - 1011-24

AB  - All gammaherpesviruses encode a glycoprotein positionally homologous to the 
      Epstein-Barr virus gp350 and the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) 
      K8.1. In this study, we characterized the positional homologous glycoprotein of 
      bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4), encoded by the Bo10 gene. We identified a 180-kDa 
      gene product, gp180, that was incorporated into the virion envelope. A Bo10 deletion 
      virus was viable but showed a growth deficit associated with reduced binding to 
      epithelial cells. This seemed to reflect an interaction of gp180 with 
      glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), since compared to the wild-type virus, the Bo10 mutant 
      virus was both less infectious for GAG-positive (GAG(+)) cells and more infectious 
      for GAG-negative (GAG(-)) cells. However, we could not identify a direct interaction 
      between gp180 and GAGs, implying that any direct interaction must be of low 
      affinity. This function of gp180 was very similar to that previously identified for 
      the murid herpesvirus 4 gp150 and also to that of the Epstein-Barr virus gp350 that 
      promotes CD21(+) cell infection and inhibits CD21(-) cell infection. We propose that 
      such proteins generally regulate virion attachment both by binding to cells and by 
      covering another receptor-binding protein until they are displaced. Thus, they 
      regulate viral tropism both positively and negatively depending upon the presence or 
      absence of their receptor.

TI  - Acute depletion of activated memory B cells involves the PD-1 pathway in rapidly 
      progressing SIV-infected macaques.
PG  - 3878-90
LID - 43271 [pii]

AB  - Rapid progression to AIDS is a significant problem, especially in developing 
      countries, where the majority of HIV-infected individuals reside. As rapid disease 
      progression is also frequently observed in SIV-infected macaques, they represent a 
      valuable tool to investigate the pathogenesis of this condition in humans. Here, we 
      have shown that pathogenic SIV infection in rhesus macaques resulted in a rapid 
      depletion (as early as week 2) of activated memory B (CD21-CD27+; mBAct) cells that 
      was strongly associated with rapid disease progression. This depletion was 
      progressive and sustained in rapid progressors, but less severe and transient in 
      typical progressors. Because of the rapid and sustained depletion of mBAct cells, 
      rapid progressors failed to develop SIV-specific Ab responses, showed a decline in 
      non-SIV-specific Ab titers, and succumbed faster to intestinal bacterial infections. 
      Depletion of mBAct cells was strongly associated with preferential depletion of 
      mBAct cells expressing programmed death-1 (PD-1), and in vitro blockade of PD-1 
      improved their survival. Furthermore, in vivo PD-1 blockade in SIV-infected macaques 
      enhanced Ab responses to non-SIV as well as SIV Ags. Our results identify depletion 
      of mBAct cells as a very early predictor of rapid disease progression in pathogenic 
      SIV infection and suggest an important role for the PD-1 pathway in depletion of 
      mBAct cells and impaired humoral immune responses in SIV-infected macaques.

TI  - Evolution of ectopic lymphoid neogenesis and in situ autoantibody production in 
      autoimmune nonobese diabetic mice: cellular and molecular characterization of 
      tertiary lymphoid structures in pancreatic islets.
PG  - 3359-68
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1001836 [doi]
AB  - A pivotal role for tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in promoting Ag-specific 
      humoral responses during chronic inflammation is emerging in several autoimmune 
      conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, and autoimmune 
      thyroiditis. However, there is limited evidence on the cellular and molecular 
      mechanisms underlying TLS formation and their contribution to autoimmunity in the 
      pancreas during autoimmune insulitis. In this study, we performed a detailed and 
      comprehensive assessment of the evolution of TLSs during autoimmune insulitis in 126 
      female NOD mice from 4 to 38 wk of age. We demonstrated that during progression from 
      peri- to intrainsulitis in early diabetic mice, T and B cell infiltration follows a 
      highly regulated process with the formation of lymphoid aggregates characterized by 
      T/B cell segregation, follicular dendritic cell networks, and differentiation of 
      germinal center B cells. This process is preceded by local upregulation of 
      lymphotoxins alpha/beta and lymphoid chemokines CXCL13 and CCL19, and is associated 
      with infiltration of B220(+)/IgD(+)/CD23(+)/CD21(-) follicular B cells expressing 
      CXCR5. Despite a similar incidence of insulitis, late diabetic mice displayed a 
      significantly reduced incidence of fully organized TLSs and reduced levels of 
      lymphotoxins/lymphoid chemokines. Upon development, TLSs were fully functional in 
      supporting in situ autoreactive B cell differentiation, as demonstrated by the 
      expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the enzyme required for Ig 
      affinity maturation and class switching, and the presence of CD138(+) plasma cells 
      displaying anti-insulin reactivity. Overall, our work provides direct evidence that 
      TLSs are of critical relevance in promoting autoimmunity and chronic inflammation 
      during autoimmune insulitis and diabetes in NOD mice.

AB  - Complement receptor 2-negative (CR2/CD21(-)) B cells have been found enriched in 
      patients with autoimmune diseases and in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) 
      patients who are prone to autoimmunity. However, the physiology of CD21(-/lo) B 
      cells remains poorly characterized. We found that some rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
      patients also display an increased frequency of CD21(-/lo) B cells in their blood. A 
      majority of CD21(-/lo) B cells from RA and CVID patients expressed germline 
      autoreactive antibodies, which recognized nuclear and cytoplasmic structures. In 
      addition, these B cells were unable to induce calcium flux, become activated, or 
      proliferate in response to B-cell receptor and/or CD40 triggering, suggesting that 
      these autoreactive B cells may be anergic. Moreover, gene array analyses of 
      CD21(-/lo) B cells revealed molecules specifically expressed in these B cells and 
      that are likely to induce their unresponsive stage. Thus, CD21(-/lo) B cells contain 
      mostly autoreactive unresponsive clones, which express a specific set of molecules 
      that may represent new biomarkers to identify anergic B cells in humans.

      spleen and bone marrow precursors.

AB  - The capacity of immature B cells of the spleen and bone marrow to differentiate in 
      vitro into cells representing mature end stage cells was investigated using B-cell 
      activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) and Notch pathway activators. 
      Immature splenic and bone marrow B cells were found, in the presence of both of 
      these activators, to mature into cells with follicular mature (FM) and marginal zone 
      (MZ) cell phenotypes. Such cells were functionally responsive to B-cell-specific 
      activation. The derivation in vitro of cells with an MZ phenotype was more robust 
      from CD23(-) populations than CD23(+) immature/transitional B cells, suggesting a 
      direct immature/T1 B cell to MZ cell differentiation pathway. Transcript analysis of 
      the in vitro-derived B-cell populations demonstrated expression profiles similar to 
      maturing B cells in vivo. FACS-purified populations of B220(+)CD19(+)CD21(-)CD23(-) 
      cells from bone marrow of 2-wk-old mice gave rise to populations of CD21(+)CD23(-) 
      cells with MZ cell phenotypes as well as CD21(+)CD23(+) cells with FM cell 
      phenotypes in percentages similar to those found in vivo. These data suggest that 
      the commitment to an MZ and FM B cell phenotype is set prior to immature B-cell 
      release from the marrow.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells have been considered to be a group of lymphocytes lacking 
      clonally distributed receptors for antigens typical of T cells and B cells. In some 
      mammalian species, including humans, a subpopulation of CD8(+) peripheral blood 
      lymphocytes (PBLs) exhibits NK activity. This NK subpopulation has not been well 
      characterized in mammals and its characterization is particularly poor in the dog. 
      In this study, we demonstrated that a subset of canine CD8(+) cells derived from 
      PBLs and lymphokine (IL-2)-activated killers (LAKs) of PBLs that was CD3(+), CD4(-), 
      CD21(-), CD5(lo), alpha/betaTCR(+), and gamma/deltaTCR(-) contained substantially 
      higher levels of mRNAs for NK cell-related receptors (NKp30, NKp44, NKG2D, 2B4, and 
      CD16 for PBL, and NKG2D and CD56 for LAK) than the corresponding CD8(-) cells. This 
      subset of CD8(+) lymphocytes derived from LAKs also displayed significantly higher 
      NK cytotoxic activity than the corresponding CD8(-) cells. In contrast, CD8(+) cells 
      derived from nonstimulated PBLs showed very low levels of NK cytotoxic activity. Our 
      results indicate that, in IL-2-stimulated PBLs, canine CD8(+) cells are an important 
      subset associated with NK cytotoxic activity.

TI  - Epstein-Barr viruses that express a CD21 antibody provide evidence that gp350's 
      functions extend beyond B-cell surface binding.
PG  - 1139-47
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01953-09 [doi]
AB  - The gp350 glycoprotein encoded by BLLF1 is crucial for efficient Epstein-Barr virus 
      (EBV) infection of resting B cells. Gp350 binds to CD21, but whether this 
      interaction sums up its functions remains unknown. We generated gp350-null EBVs that 
      display CD19-, CD21-, or CD22-specific antibodies at their surface (designated as 
      DeltaBLLF1-Ab). Gp350-complemented (DeltaBLLF1-C) and DeltaBLLF1-Ab were found to 
      bind equally well to B cells. Surprisingly, DeltaBLLF1 binding was reduced only 
      1.7-fold relative to its complemented counterparts. Furthermore, B cells exposed to 
      DeltaBLLF1-Ab or DeltaBLLF1 viruses presented structural antigens with comparable 
      efficiency and achieved 25 to 80% of the T-cell activation elicited by DeltaBLLF1-C. 
      These findings show that the gp350-CD21 interaction pair plays only a modest role 
      during virus transfer to the endosomal compartment. However, primary B cells or Raji 
      B cells infected with DeltaBLLF1-C viruses displayed a 35- to 70-fold higher 
      infection rates than those exposed to DeltaBLLF1, DeltaBLLF1-CD22Ab, or 
      DeltaBLLF1-CD19Ab viruses. Complementation of the gp350 knockout phenotype with 
      CD21Ab substantially enhanced infection rates relative to DeltaBLLF1 but remained 
      sevenfold (Raji B-cell line) to sixfold (primary B cells) less efficient than with 
      gp350. We therefore infer that gp350 mainly exerts its functions after the 
      internalization step, presumably during release of the viral capsid from the 
      endosomal compartment, and that CD21-dependent but also CD21-independent molecular 
      mechanisms are involved in this process. The latter appear to be characteristic of 
      B-cell infection since transfection of CD21 in 293 cells improved the infection 
      rates with both DeltaBLLF1-CD21Ab and DeltaBLLF1-C to a similar extent.

TI  - Ectodomain shedding and generation of two carboxy-terminal fragments of human 
      complement receptor 2/CD21.
PG  - 2630-9
LID - 10.1016/j.molimm.2009.04.036 [doi]
AB  - Numerous cell surface proteins are functionally regulated by a proteolytic cleavage 
      event termed 'ectodomain shedding'. The complement receptor 2/CD21 extracellular 
      domain (ectodomain) is constitutively released as a soluble form (sCD21), but its 
      liberation can also be induced by various physiological and pharmacological stimuli. 
      CD21-shedding modulates B cell activation, and sCD21 can activate other immune cells 
      and allows transfer of immune complexes from marginal zone B cells to follicular 
      dendritic cells. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of CD21 augments CD21-shedding, 
      while removal of the extracellular membrane-adjacent short consensus repeat 16 
      abolishes shedding. Carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) and intracellular domains 
      (ICDs) result from ectodomain shedding and regulated intramembrane cleavage (RIP) of 
      CTFs, respectively. By modulating gene transcription, CTFs and ICDs can regulate 
      cell function and homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that two membrane-tethered CD21 
      CTFs of 8 and 16kDa are constitutively present in human B cells, while only the 8kDa 
      CTF was detectable in murine B cells. Glutathione (GSH) regulates extracellular 
      redox levels and is a known inducer of CD21-shedding. Interestingly, GSH-treatment 
      of B lymphocytes only augmented sCD21 levels, but not CD21-CTF levels. In contrast, 
      B cell activation led to increased CD21-CTF levels, suggesting a functional role for 
      the CD21-CTFs in B cell activation and maintenance of B cell homeostasis.

TI  - Features distinguishing Epstein-Barr virus infections of epithelial cells and B 
      cells: viral genome expression, genome maintenance, and genome amplification.
PG  - 7749-60
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00108-09 [doi]
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with malignant diseases of lymphoid and 
      epithelial cell origin. The tropism of EBV is due to B-cell-restricted expression of 
      CD21, the major receptor molecule for the virus. However, efficient infection of 
      CD21- epithelial cells can be achieved via transfer from EBV-coated B cells. We 
      compare and contrast here the early events following in vitro infection of primary B 
      cells and epithelial cells. Using sensitive, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR 
      assays for several latent and lytic transcripts and two-color immunofluorescence 
      staining to analyze expression at the single cell level, we confirmed and extended 
      previous reports indicating that the two cell types support different patterns of 
      transcription. Furthermore, whereas infection of B cells with one or two copies of 
      EBV resulted in rapid amplification of the viral genome to >20 copies per cell, such 
      amplification was not normally observed after infection of primary epithelial cells 
      or undifferentiated epithelial lines. In epithelial cells, EBNA1 expression was 
      detected in only ca. 40% of EBER+ cells, and the EBV genome was subsequently lost 
      during prolonged culture. One exception was that infection of AGS, a gastric 
      carcinoma line, resulted in maintenance of EBNA1 expression and amplification of the 
      EBV episome. In contrast to B cells, where amplification of the EBV episome occurred 
      even with a replication-defective BZLF1-knockout virus, amplification in AGS cells 
      was dependent upon early lytic cycle gene expression. These data highlight the 
      influence of the host cell on the outcome of EBV infection with regard to genome 
      expression, amplification, and maintenance.

TI  - Clinical significance of co-expression of CD21 and LFA-1 in B-cell lymphoma.
PG  - 497-507
LID - 10.1007/s12185-009-0303-8 [doi]
AB  - We previously reported that the prognosis of CD21-positive diffuse large B-cell 
      lymphoma (DLBCL) is significantly favorable to that of CD21-negative DLBCL (Otsuka 
      et al. in Br J Haematol 127:416-424, 2004). In this study, we attempted to clarify 
      the biological significance of CD21 expression in B-cell lymphoma (BCL) by 
      performing in vitro experiments using CD21 transfection into a CD21-negative 
      lymphoma cell line and analyzing clinical data from lymphoma samples. Established 
      clones of CD21 transfectants showed homotypic aggregation in suspension culture. 
      Analysis of integrin expression revealed that LFA-1 appeared to be expressed on CD21 
      transfectants, and the cell aggregation was abrogated by anti-LFA-1 antibody. The 
      CD21 transfectants could adhere to plastic plates coated with ICAM-1. Moreover, flow 
      cytometry and/or immunohistochemical analyses of clinical BCL samples (n = 29) 
      revealed positive for CD21 in all cases; LFA-1 was also expressed without exception. 
      All BCL cells isolated from cavity fluids (n = 10) failed to express both CD21 and 
      LFA-1. These data suggest that CD21 is tightly related to LFA-1 expression in BCL 
      and the absence of CD21/LFA-1 expression is associated with pleural/peritoneal fluid 
      involvement by BCL, a potential indicator of disease progression of BCL.

TI  - IL-4 increases CD21-dependent infection of pulmonary alveolar epithelial type II 
      cells by EBV.
PG  - 1905-10
LID - 10.1016/j.molimm.2009.01.002 [doi]
AB  - EBV infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary 
      Fibrosis (IPF). Viral infection may occur from the early or late stage in IPF 
      development. Whether alveolar epithelial cells, AECs, normally express EBV main 
      receptor, CD21, remains uncertain. Such situations prompted us to exploit an 
      efficient direct infection system to investigate EBV receptor repertoire in primary 
      human AECs. Using human primary type 2 AECs, which have been grown in basal medium 
      supplemented with 10 ng/ml Keratinocyte Growth Factor, and type 1 AECs, supplemented 
      with Epithelial Growth Factor, both AEC lines express CD21 mRNA and protein with a 
      significant increase in type 2 cells. Type 2 AECs have been exposed to TGFbeta1 and 
      IL-4, whose expression is associated with IPF development. CD21 is highly expressed 
      in type 2 AECs following IL-4 exposure. EBV bound to type 2 AECs membrane increases 
      significantly following pre-treatment with IL-4 (p<0.001) and decreasing 
      antagonizing CD21 receptor (p<0.01). 200 microg/ml G418-mediated selection of 
      EBV-Neomycin resistant infected cells selected IL-4 pre-exposed type 2 AECs. Our 
      study of a viral cell line model provides evidence to suggest that CD21-dependent 
      viral entry plays a crucial role in type 2 AECs, indicative of an IL-4 response EBV 
      infection in IPF.

TI  - Atypical immunophenotype in a littoral cell angioma.
PG  - 63-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Littoral-cell angioma (LCA) is a recently described benign vascular 
      tumor of the spleen, whose imaging and pathologic characteristics have been 
      discussed only by a few authors. The tumor is characterized by a mixture of 
      papillary and cystic areas lined by neoplastic cells deriving from normal splenic 
      lining--littoral cells. The neoplastic LCA cells express both endothelial and 
      histiocytic antigens associated with CD8 negativity, compared with the normal 
      endothelium of the venous sinuses of the spleen red pulp that only expresses 
      endothelial antigens and CD8 positivity. Therefore, the typical and characteristic 
      immunohistochemical pattern of the LCA is as follows: CD31, CD68, CD163, CD21, FVIII 
      antigen positive; CD34, CD8 negative. CASE REPORT: We reported a 60-year-old male 
      with moderate nodular splenomegaly with one large hypoechogenic solid lesion and 
      mild thrombocytopenia in whom the diagnosis of LCA was made after the elective 
      splenectomy. Namely, histopathological and immunohistochemical data allowed a final 
      diagnosis of classical LCA in spite of CD21 negativity. As far as we know this is 
      the first reporeted CD21-negative LCA patient. Histological specimens were presented 
      and differential diagnoses discussed. CONCLUSION: Littoral-cell angioma is a very 
      rare benign splenic neoplasm that should be considered in the differential diagnosis 
      of multinodular splenomegaly, particularly if the patient has the signs of 
      hypersplenism.

TI  - B-cell activation in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) by 
      FIP-virus-induced B-cell differentiation/survival factors.
PG  - 27-35
LID - 10.1007/s00705-008-0265-9 [doi]
AB  - It has been suggested that antibody overproduction plays a role in the pathogenesis 
      of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). However, only a few studies on the B-cell 
      activation mechanism after FIP virus (FIPV) infection have been reported. The 
      present study shows that: (1) the ratio of peripheral blood sIg(+) CD21(-) B-cells 
      was higher in cats with FIP than in SPF cats, (2) the albumin-to-globulin ratio has 
      negative correlation with the ratio of peripheral blood sIg(+) CD21(-) B-cell, (3) 
      cells strongly expressing mRNA of the plasma cell master gene, B-lymphocyte-induced 
      maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1), were increased in peripheral blood in cats with FIP, 
      (4) mRNA expression of B-cell differentiation/survival factors, IL-6, CD40 ligand, 
      and B-cell-activating factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF), 
      was enhanced in macrophages in cats with FIP, and (5) mRNAs of these B-cell 
      differentiation/survival factors were overexpressed in antibody-dependent 
      enhancement (ADE)-induced macrophages. These data suggest that virus-infected 
      macrophages overproduce B-cell differentiation/survival factors, and these factors 
      act on B-cells and promote B-cell differentiation into plasma cells in FIPV-infected 
      cats.

TI  - Oncogenic transformation in the absence of Xrcc4 targets peripheral B cells that 
      have undergone editing and switching.
PG  - 3079-90
LID - 10.1084/jem.20082271 [doi]
AB  - Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during 
      V(D)J recombination in developing lymphocytes and during immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy 
      chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR) in peripheral B lymphocytes. We now 
      show that CD21-cre-mediated deletion of the Xrcc4 NHEJ gene in p53-deficient 
      peripheral B cells leads to recurrent surface Ig-negative B lymphomas ("CXP 
      lymphomas"). Remarkably, CXP lymphomas arise from peripheral B cells that had 
      attempted both receptor editing (secondary V[D]J recombination of Igkappa and 
      Iglambda light chain genes) and IgH CSR subsequent to Xrcc4 deletion. 
      Correspondingly, CXP tumors frequently harbored a CSR-based reciprocal chromosomal 
      translocation that fused IgH to c-myc, as well as large chromosomal deletions or 
      translocations involving Igkappa or Iglambda, with the latter fusing Iglambda to 
      oncogenes or to IgH. Our findings reveal peripheral B cells that have undergone both 
      editing and CSR and show them to be common progenitors of CXP tumors. Our studies 
      also reveal developmental stage-specific mechanisms of c-myc activation via IgH 
      locus translocations. Thus, Xrcc4/p53-deficient pro-B lymphomas routinely activate 
      c-myc by gene amplification, whereas Xrcc4/p53-deficient peripheral B cell lymphomas 
      routinely ectopically activate a single c-myc copy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disorder 
      affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands. The aim of this study was to explore 
      immunophenotypic features of chronic inflammatory reactions in the minor salivary 
      glands in patients with primary SS (pSS). METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
      labial minor salivary gland tissue sections from randomly selected patients with pSS 
      (n = 60) were investigated for the expression of CD21, CD23, CD35 and IgD by 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Based on the distribution and staining pattern of 
      CD21, CD23, CD35 and IgD in lymphoid aggregates, several stages of chronic 
      inflammatory reactions were observed. In 12/60 (20%) patients, lymphoid infiltrates 
      with germinal centre (GC)-like features such as extensive networks of CD21-, CD23- 
      and CD35-positive cells were observed in the minor salivary gland tissue. Smaller 
      networks and /or focal infiltrates with scattered CD21(+), CD23(+) and CD35(+) cells 
      were observed in the remaining 48/60 (80 %) cases. When dividing patients according 
      to the presence (GC+) or the absence (GC-) of GC in the minor salivary glands, the 
      mean focus score was significantly higher in the GC+ patients (P < 0.05). Double 
      staining of the minor salivary glands revealed focal infiltrates with follicular 
      dentritic cell networks and B cells resembling normal GCs in tonsillar tissue. 
      CONCLUSION: A particular cellular profile was demonstrated in a sub-group of 
      patients with pSS and could be linked to serological aberrations. These findings 
      warrant further prospective studies.

TI  - Systemic reduction of soluble complement receptor II/CD21 during pregnancy to levels 
      reminiscent of autoimmune disease.
PG  - 1137-41
LID - 10.1007/s00296-008-0604-x [doi]
AB  - Complement receptor type II/CD21 is the functional receptor for complement fragments 
      such as C3d, iC3b and the Epstein Barr Virus. A soluble form of CD21 (sCD21) is shed 
      from lymphocytes surface and is able to bind to its ligands found in the plasma. The 
      amount of sCD21 in serum may modulate immunity as the plasma levels are correlated 
      with autoimmune conditions, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Rheumatoid 
      Arthritis and Sjoegren's Syndrome. Because of the fact that pregnancy may lead to 
      remission of autoimmune diseases we determined the serum levels of sCD21 during 
      pregnancy and postpartum. The serum sCD21 levels during pregnancy are significantly 
      lower as compared to that of the healthy controls. There were no significant 
      differences in sCD21 levels between the mother and the cord blood also immediately 
      after parturition. Restoration of sCD21 levels to normal values takes between 6 
      weeks and 1 year after childbirth. Our study indicates that CD21-shedding is 
      affected during pregnancy comparable to that of autoimmunity.

TI  - Censoring of autoreactive B cell development by the pre-B cell receptor.
PG  - 696-9
LID - 10.1126/science.1157533 [doi]
AB  - Antibody diversity occurs randomly as B cells recombine their immunoglobulin (Ig) 
      heavy- and light-chain genes during development. This process inevitably generates 
      reactivity against self structures, and several mechanisms prevent the development 
      of autoreactive B cells. We report here a role for the pre-B cell receptor, composed 
      of Ig heavy and surrogate light chains, in the negative selection of cells 
      expressing Ig heavy chains with the potential to generate autoantibodies. Surrogate 
      light-chain-deficient (SLC-/-) mice harbored elevated levels of antinuclear 
      antibodies (ANAs) in their serum and showed evidence of escape of pre-B cells 
      expressing prototypic autoantibody heavy chains from negative selection, leading to 
      mature autoantibody secreting CD21-CD23- B cells in the periphery. Thus, the pre-B 
      cell receptor appears to censor the development of certain autoantibody-secreting 
      cells and may represent an important factor in multifactorial autoimmune diseases.

      expression.
PG  - 562-70

AB  - This study investigated the gene expression profiles of 40 cases of diffuse large 
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) according to CD21 expression, a favourable prognostic factor 
      in DLBCL. Signature genes were analysed by Gene Ontology Tree Machine, and genes 
      concerned with the immune system and related categories were significantly 
      upregulated in CD21- DLBCLs. Of 40 DLBCLs, four were germinal centre B cell-like 
      (GCB) and 36 non-GCB. Of the 36 non-GCB DLBCLs, 14 CD21+ DLBCLs showed significantly 
      better overall survival than the 22 CD21- DLBCLs (P = 0.036). Hierarchical cluster 
      analysis of signature genes related to CD21 was applied to previously published data 
      sets, resulting in two groups for each data set, CD21+ type DLBCLs and CD21- type 
      DLBCLs. Survival of CD21+ type DLBCLs was significantly better than that of CD21- 
      type (P = 0.006 and P = 0.004, respectively). In both data sets, CD21+ type DLBCLs 
      predominantly included GCB DLBCLs compared with CD21- type. The top classifier gene 
      of CD21 expression was IGHM, and the five of nine Gene Ontology categories 
      significant in CD21- DLBCLs included IGHM. Immunohistochemical analysis of 216 
      DLBCLs confirmed that overall survival of surface (s) IgM+ DLBCLs was significantly 
      poorer than that of sIgM- DLBCLs (P = 0.013).

TI  - Impaired naive and memory B-cell responsiveness to TLR9 stimulation in human 
      immunodeficiency virus infection.
PG  - 7837-45
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00660-08 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists such as unmethylated bacterial CpG DNAs 
      activate B lymphocytes directly, potentially influencing their function and 
      homeostasis. To assess B-cell responsiveness to TLR9 agonists in human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, we examined the ability of naive and memory B 
      cells to proliferation and to increase surface expression of CD80 in response to CpG 
      oligonucleotides (ODN). CpG ODN induced expression of CD80 similarly in B cells from 
      HIV-infected persons and from healthy controls. In contrast, proliferation responses 
      to CpG ODN were markedly impaired in both naive and memory B-cell subsets from 
      HIV-infected persons. Naive B-cell proliferation defects were related to plasma HIV 
      RNA and, among memory B cells, to the frequencies of CD21-negative cells. 
      Importantly, TLR9 mRNA levels were significantly diminished in freshly prepared 
      naive B cells and especially so in memory B cells from HIV-positive viremic donors, 
      suggesting a possible underlying mechanism for the observed functional impairments. 
      Dose-response studies indicated that optimal induction of CD80 expression was 
      achieved with much lower concentrations of CpG ODN than optimal induction of 
      proliferation. We propose that the relatively low threshold of activation that is 
      required for CD80 induction by CpG ODN might explain the preservation of this 
      response in B cells from HIV-infected persons despite diminished TLR9 expression. 
      Impaired responsiveness to TLR9 agonists may contribute to defects in humoral 
      immunity in HIV infection.

TI  - A unique B2 B cell subset in the intestine.
PG  - 1343-55
LID - 10.1084/jem.20071572 [doi]
AB  - Over 80% of the body's activated B cells are located in mucosal sites, including the 
      intestine. The intestine contains IgM(+) B cells, but these cells have not been 
      characterized phenotypically or in terms of their developmental origins. We describe 
      a previously unidentified and unique subset of immunoglobulin M(+) B cells that 
      present with an AA4.1(-)CD21(-)CD23(-) major histocompatibility complex class 
      II(bright) surface phenotype and are characterized by a low frequency of somatic 
      hypermutation and the potential ability to produce interleukin-12p70. This B cell 
      subset resides within the normal mucosa of the large intestine and expands in 
      response to inflammation. Some of these intestinal B cells originate from the 
      AA4.1(+) immature B2 cell pool in the steady state and are also recruited from the 
      recirculating naive B cell pool in the context of intestinal inflammation. They 
      develop in an antigen-independent and BAFF-dependent manner in the absence of T cell 
      help. Expansion of these cells can be induced in the absence of the spleen and 
      gut-associated lymphoid tissues. These results describe the existence of an 
      alternative pathway of B cell maturation in the periphery that gives rise to a 
      tissue-specific B cell subset.

TI  - B-cell maturation defects in common variable immunodeficiency and association with 
      clinical features.
PG  - 288-94
LID - 10.1080/00313020801911470 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) often have defects in 
      post-antigenic B-cell differentiation with fewer memory B cells and impaired isotype 
      switching. We aimed to classify CVID patients according to these defects and 
      determine whether this predicted clinical manifestations. METHODS: We analysed the 
      memory marker CD27, maturation marker CD21, and IgD on peripheral blood B cells from 
      31 CVID patients and 23 controls using a whole-blood lysis technique, allocated 
      patients according to two classifications ('Freiburg' and 'Paris') and correlated 
      results with clinical manifestations. RESULTS: CVID patients had fewer memory 
      (CD27(+)) B cells and isotype-switched (IgD(-)) memory B cells in absolute number 
      and proportion. Many CVID patients had increased immature (CD21(-)) B cells. 
      Lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenias were found almost exclusively in these 
      patients, including Freiburg group Ia (decreased switched memory and increased 
      immature B cells), but also those with normal switched memory and increased immature 
      B cells. The Paris classification was less useful in predicting clinical 
      manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: CVID is associated with defects in memory B-cell 
      differentiation. Subclassification helps identify patients with clinical 
      manifestations, particularly lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenias in those 
      with impaired B-cell maturation and isotype switching. Routine B-cell phenotyping 
      may assist clinicians in predicting these clinical features.

TI  - Modulation of murine complement receptor type 2 (CR2/CD21) ectodomain shedding by 
      its cytoplasmic domain.
PG  - 2127-37
LID - 10.1016/j.molimm.2007.12.015 [doi]
AB  - Ectodomain shedding is a mechanism that regulates numerous functions of cell surface 
      proteins. The extracellular domain of the human complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21) is 
      released by proteolytic cleavage as a soluble protein through a variety of stimuli 
      including the thiol antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH), and 
      the oxidant pervanadate (PV). In addition, PV mimics B cell antigen receptor (BCR) 
      signaling. Here, we show that murine CD21 is shed upon those stimuli and that the 
      cytoplasmic domain is an important modulator for CD21-shedding. B cells expressing a 
      mutant CD21 cytoplasmic domain with only three amino acids (KHR) showed increased 
      CD21-shedding and required lower stimuli concentrations. At lower PV concentrations, 
      wildtype CD21 was up-regulated on the cell surface, whereas at higher PV 
      concentrations the ectodomain was shed. These findings further indicate that GSH and 
      NAC utilize different pathways than PV to activate CD21-shedding. Altogether, as 
      pre-activated B cells express higher CD21 levels than resting mature B cells or 
      fully activated and antigen-experienced B cells, we suggest CD21-shedding to be a 
      mechanism to fine-tune B cell activation.

PG  - 163-7
LID - 10.1016/j.imlet.2007.12.010 [doi]
AB  - In mice CR1 and CR2 are encoded at a single locus and the two alternatively spliced 
      RNA transcripts of the CD21 gene generate murine CR1 and CR2 (CR1/2). While the 
      function of CD21 has been extensively studied on murine B lymphocytes, much less is 
      known about its appearance and role on T cells. Earlier we had demonstrated the 
      expression of CR1/2 on activated murine T cells by cytofluorymetry and 
      immunoprecipitation and proposed its role in the enhancement of antigen presentation 
      by B cells and macrophages bearing C3-fragments. In this study we analyze the 
      expression-profile and further possible roles of CR1/2 on T lymphocytes. We describe 
      a CR1/2 expressing CD4+ T cell subpopulation present in the mesenteric lymph nodes 
      of mice. We show that these cells can be activated by the CD21-specific 7G6 single 
      chain antibody, and demonstrate that activation via this complement receptor results 
      in the translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus. Interestingly we found a 
      substantial elevation of CD21+ T cells during both spontaneous and ceramide-induced 
      apoptosis.

PG  - 3861-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0800025105 [doi]
AB  - Tolerance to dsDNA is achieved through editing of Ig receptors that react with 
      dsDNA. Nevertheless, some B cells with anti-dsDNA receptors escape editing and 
      migrate to the spleen. Certain anti-dsDNA B cells that are recovered as hybridomas 
      from the spleens of anti-dsDNA H chain transgenic mice also bind an additional, 
      Golgi-associated antigen. B cells that bind this antigen accumulate intracellular 
      IgM. The intracellular accumulation of IgM is incomplete, because IgM clusters are 
      observed at the cell surface. In the spleen, B cells that express the heavy and 
      light chains encoding this IgM are surface IgM-bright and acquire the 
      CD21-high/CD23-low phenotype of marginal zone B cells. Our data imply that 
      expression of an Ig that binds dsDNA and an additional antigen expressed in the 
      secretory compartment renders B cells resistant to central tolerance. In the 
      periphery, these B cells may be sequestered in the splenic marginal zone.

TI  - Flow cytometric analysis of canine umbilical cord blood lymphocytes.
PG  - 285-7
AB  - Lymphocyte subsets in canine umbilical cord blood were flow cytometrically analyzed 
      and compared with those of the dams' peripheral blood. The proportion of CD3+ T 
      lymphocytes, CD21+CD3- B lymphocytes, and CD3-CD21- non-T non-B lymphocytes in 
      umbilical cord blood was 52.9%, 30.4%, and 16.7%, respectively. T lymphocyte/B 
      lymphocyte ratio was significantly lower in the umbilical cord blood than in the 
      dams' peripheral blood (2.1 +/- 1.4 versus 11.0 +/- 8.1, P < 0.001). In contrast, 
      CD4+ lymphocyte/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio was significantly higher in the umbilical cord 
      blood than in the dams' peripheral blood (7.6 +/- 2.2 versus 1.8 +/- 0.6, P<0.001). 
      These findings clarified the phenotypic characters of canine umbilical cord blood 
      lymphocytes.

TI  - Elevated numbers of immature/transitional CD21- B lymphocytes and deficiency of 
      memory CD27+ B cells identify patients with active chronic graft-versus-host 
      disease.
PG  - 208-19
LID - 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.10.009 [doi]
AB  - Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and a leading cause of non-relapse 
      mortality (NRM). Currently, biology-based markers are lacking both for diagnosis and 
      for monitoring the activity of cGVHD. Seventy patients who received HSCT were 
      enrolled in a pilot study, including 21 without cGVHD and 49 with active or resolved 
      cGVHD. Evaluations were comprised of clinical parameters including cGVHD severity 
      and infections. Peripheral blood cells were analyzed by multi-parameter flow 
      cytometry. The CD19+ B cell compartment was further subdivided by staining for 
      surface IgD, CD21 and CD27. No significant differences in absolute B, T, and natural 
      killer (NK) cell numbers were observed between the groups with and without cGVHD. 
      However, elevated numbers (>15% of B lymphocytes) of immature/transitional 
      CD19+/CD21(-) B cells were associated with the occurrence of severe infections (P = 
      .003). Most significantly, all patients with active cGVHD and elevated numbers of 
      CD19+/CD21(-) B lymphocytes experienced severe infections (P = .00016). The numbers 
      of both non-class-switched and class-switched memory B cells were significantly 
      lower in patients with active cGVHD when compared to patients who never experienced 
      cGVHD (P = .002 and P = .001). Perturbation of circulating B lymphocyte compartments 
      may serve as a novel biomarker for monitoring cGVHD activity and its impact on the 
      immune system. A prospective study on unselected patients assessed serially for B 
      cell reconstitution after HSCT is warranted.

      immune system. They play an important role in the immune response against infections 
      as well as tumour cells and therefore have two major properties: production of 
      immune regulatory cytokines and chemokines as well as cytolytic destruction of 
      particular target cells. The existence of NK cells in swine is well known as well as 
      the phenotype of resting NK cells, but their response following activation by 
      cytokines is still poorly understood. Therefore, we tested the influence of the 
      immune regulatory cytokines IL-2, IL-12 and IL-18 on cytolytic activity, phenotype, 
      IFN-gamma production and the accumulation of perforin in cytoplasm of peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as purified NK cells. NK cells were enriched 
      from PBMC using a magnetic cell separation (MACS) strategy with monoclonal 
      antibodies against CD3, CD21 and SWC3, thereby removing T-, B- and myeloid cells. 
      Respective fractions were used in flow cytometry (FCM) based cytolytic assays with 
      the human tumour cell line K562 as target. After stimulation with the cytokines 
      described above, the NK cell enriched CD3(-)CD21(-)SWC3(-) fraction showed an 
      evident increase in the cytolytic activity compared to PBMC. This enhanced cytolytic 
      activity was accompanied by a strong enrichment of IFN-gamma producing cells when a 
      combination of all three cytokines (IL-2/IL-12/IL-18) was used; as determined in 
      ELISPOT assays and intracellular staining of IFN-gamma in FCM. Also, the combination 
      of these three cytokines led to an accumulation of perforin in the cytoplasm and an 
      up-regulation of CD25 compared to control cultures incubated in medium without 
      cytokines. The experiments performed clearly indicate a stimulatory role and strong 
      synergistic effects of the investigated cytokines in the activation of porcine NK 
      cells in vitro, inducing IFN-gamma, perforin production and cytotoxicity against 
      target cells.

TI  - High CD21 expression inhibits internalization of anti-CD19 antibodies and 
      cytotoxicity of an anti-CD19-drug conjugate.
PG  - 46-58
AB  - CD19 and CD21 (CR2) are co-receptors found on B-cells and various B-cell lymphomas, 
      including non-Hodgkin lymphoma. To evaluate their suitability as targets for therapy 
      of such lymphomas using internalization-dependent antibody-drug conjugates [such as 
      antibody-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, 
      (N2'-deacetyl-N2'-(3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)-maytansine) (MCC-DM1) conjugates, which 
      require lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety for efficacy], we examined 
      uptake of antibodies to CD19 and CD21 in a panel of B-cell lines. Anti-CD21 
      antibodies were not sufficiently internalized even in the highest CD21-expressing 
      Raji cells, resulting in lack of efficacy with anti-CD21-MCC-DM1 conjugates. 
      Anti-CD19 antibody uptake was variable, and was unexpectedly negatively correlated 
      with CD21 expression. Thus, high CD21-expressing Raji, ARH77 and primary B-cells 
      only very slowly internalized anti-CD19 antibodies, while CD21-negative or low 
      expressing cells, including Ramos and Daudi, rapidly internalized these antibodies 
      in clathrin-coated vesicles followed by lysosomal delivery. Anti-CD19-MCC-DM1 caused 
      greater cytotoxicity in the faster anti-CD19-internalizing cell lines, implying that 
      the rate of lysosomal delivery and subsequent drug release is important. 
      Furthermore, transfection of Ramos cells with CD21 impeded anti-CD19 uptake and 
      decreased anti-CD19-MCC-DM1 efficacy, suggesting that CD21-negative tumours should 
      respond better to such anti-CD19 conjugates. This may have possible clinical 
      implications, as anti-CD21 immunohistochemistry revealed only approximately 30% of 
      54 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients lack CD21 expression.

TI  - CD27(+) peripheral blood B-cells are a useful biodosimetric marker in vitro.
PG  - 589-600
AB  - The CD8(+) natural killer (NK) subpopulation has recently been identified as a fast 
      and reliable biodosimetric indicator within human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMC) in vitro. In irradiated and subsequently cultivated PBMC, a decrease of the 
      relative number of intact CD3(-)CD8(+) lymphocytes 16 and 48 h after treatment has 
      allowed for estimating the received dose in the range of 0 - 10 Gy and 
      lethal/sublethal dose discrimination, respectively. Here we show that suitable 
      biodosimeters can also be found in the peripheral blood B-cell compartment. 
      Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of irradiated and subsequently cultivated 
      human PBMC revealed that both the CD27(+) and CD21(-) B-cell subpopulations can be 
      used as biodosimeters and the CD19(+)CD27(+) lymphocytes have proved useful for 
      retrospective determination of the received dose in the range of 0 - 6 Gy. In 
      addition, several CD19(+) lymphocyte subsets characterized by co expression of CD21, 
      CD27 and CD38 have been shown to bear biodosimetric potential, too. However, when 
      important parameters like the original size within the CD19(+) compartment, its 
      radiation-induced changes and data variation had been taken into account, the 
      CD27(+) subpopulation proved superior to the other B-cell subpopulations and 
      subsets. It appears that, in the dose range of 0 - 6 Gy, the relative decrease of 
      CD27(+) B lymphocytes provides more sensitive and reliable data than that of CD8(+) 
      NK-cells due mainly to lower data variation. In contrast to CD27(+) B cells, the 
      proportions of CD27(+) subpopulations of T-cells were not affected by irradiation. 
      We have also proposed a simple experimental protocol based on full blood cultivation 
      and three-color CD27/CD3/CD19 immuno-phenotyping as a time-saving and inexpensive 
      approach for practical biodosimetric evaluations on simple, three-to-four color flow 
      cytometers.

TI  - Development of a murine model for blastoid variant mantle-cell lymphoma.
PG  - 4899-906
AB  - Blastoid-variant mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL-BV), unlike most B-cell non-Hodgkin 
      lymphomas (NHL-Bs), is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and associated with a 
      very poor prognosis. Development of new therapies has been hampered by the lack of 
      valid animal models. We have developed a novel murine model of MCL-BV by crossing 
      interleukin 14alpha (IL-14alpha) transgenic mice with c-Myc transgenic mice (double 
      transgenic [DTG]). IL-14alpha is a B-cell growth factor that is expressed in a 
      number of high-grade lymphomas, including MCL-BV. Ninety-five percent of IL-14alpha 
      transgenic mice develop CD5(+) large B-cell lymphomas by 18 months of age. Sixty 
      percent of c-Myc transgenic mice develop pre-B-cell lymphomas by 12 months of age. 
      Close to 100% of DTG mice develop an aggressive, rapidly fatal lymphoma at 3 to 4 
      months of age that is CD5(+), CD19(+), CD21(-), CD23(-), sIgM(+). The tumor is found 
      in the blood, bone marrow, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and 
      lungs and rarely in the brain, similar to the involvement seen in human MCL-BV. 
      Immunoglobulin gene rearrangements document the monoclonality of the tumor. Cyclin 
      D1 is highly expressed in these tumors, as it is in MCL-BV. DTG represents a novel 
      model for MCL-BV that should reveal important insights into the pathogenesis of the 
      lymphoma and contribute to the development of new forms of therapy.

TI  - Reactive peripheral blood plasmacytosis in a patient with acute hepatitis A.
PG  - 191-4
AB  - Reactive plasmacytosis is a transient expansion of plasma cell progenitors and 
      precursors. This rare condition has been reported to occur mainly in infections and 
      tumors. We describe a case of acute hepatitis A presenting with marked peripheral 
      blood plasmacytosis. Plasma cells made up 27.5% of the mononuclear cells and had the 
      immunophenotype CD10-CD19+CD20-CD21-CD23-CD34-CD38++HLA-DR+. Although the level of 
      interleukin 6 was not increased, the presence of activated T-cells with an inverted 
      CD4/CD8 ratio and high levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor and neopterin 
      indicated a marked immune response to acute hepatitis A. The patient's plasma cells 
      had almost disappeared from the blood by hospital day 16. This report may represent 
      the first described case of reactive peripheral blood plasmacytosis in acute 
      hepatitis A.

TI  - Analysis of class-switched memory B cells in patients with common variable 
      immunodeficiency and its clinical implications.
PG  - 321-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) comprises a heterogeneous group 
      of primary immunodeficiency disorders characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia leading 
      to recurrent infections. Some patients with CVID are more susceptible to earlier 
      onset of respiratory disease and bronchiectasis. It has been suggested that memory B 
      cells, characterized by CD27 expression, can be used as a means to classify subsets 
      of CVID patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to classify a sample of 
      Iranian patients with CVID by quantification of peripheral blood memory B cells and 
      immature B cells and to assess the relationship between this classification and the 
      clinical characteristics of the patients. METHODS: The study included 29 patients 
      with CVID and 20 healthy controls. Patients were grouped as follows, according to 
      the quantification of peripheral memory B cells: group I had less than 0.4% switched 
      memory B cells (CD27+, immunoglobulin [Ig] M-, IgD-) in peripheral blood lymphocytes 
      (PBL), while in group II switched memory B cells represented more than 0.4% of PBL. 
      Group I patients were further subdivided into groups Ia and Ib according to the 
      proportion of CD21- peripheral B cells. The clinical and laboratory findings for the 
      patients were then compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: The percentage of switched 
      memory B cells (CD27+IgM-IgD- cells in peripheral B lymphocytes) was markedly 
      reduced in CVID patients compared with controls (P < .001). This percentage was less 
      than 0.4% (group I) in 20 patients (69%) (P < .05). In the remaining 9 patients 
      (group II) and all healthy controls, the percentage was greater than 0.4%. 
      Bronchiectasis was more frequent in group I than group II (P < .05). Following 
      subdivision of group I patients into groups Ia and Ib based on CD21 peripheral B 
      cells, the rate of autoimmunity was found to be much higher in group Ia than group 
      Ib. CONCLUSIONS: CVID patients with reduced numbers of switched memory B cells are 
      more prone to recurrent respiratory infections and development of bronchiectasis, 
      and as such, need more special care than other CVID patients. Thus, classification 
      of CVID patients by assessment of switched memory B cells could help physicians to 
      predict clinical prognosis of these patients.

TI  - Two-step fluorescence screening of CD21-binding peptides with one-bead one-compound 
      library and investigation of binding properties of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide 
      copolymer-peptide conjugates.
PG  - 3037-46
AB  - Using the one-bead one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial method, four heptapeptide 
      ligands of CD21 receptor, a cell surface marker of malignant B cell lymphoma, were 
      identified with an innovative two-step fluorescence screening method to overcome the 
      limitation caused by autofluorescence of TentaGel resin. The binding affinities of 
      selected peptides, YILIHRN (B1), PTLDPLP (B2), and LVLLTRE (B3), were in the 
      micromolar region as determined by a fluorescence quenching assay. Peptide B1 was 
      conjugated to N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer via spacers of 
      different lengths, composed of one to four repeats of the 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic 
      acid (A) group. The evaluation of the biorecognizability of HPMA copolymer-B1 
      conjugates by the CD21 receptor revealed that increasing the number of repeats of A 
      in the spacer from one to three resulted in continuous improvements in the 
      biorecognition by the CD21 receptor; the increase from three to four repeats showed 
      no significant effect. This work showed the potential of the OBOC combinatorial 
      approach to select peptide ligands as targeting moieties for CD21 specific polymeric 
      drug carriers.

TI  - Improved gene delivery to B lymphocytes using a modified adenovirus vector targeting 
      CD21.
PG  - 293-304
AB  - Gene transfer by adenoviruses, which are widely used for gene therapy, may provide 
      an alternative approach to treatment of several hematopoietic malignancies. However, 
      a major limitation of adenovirus 5-based gene therapy lies in the natural tropism of 
      the virus for the widely expressed hCAR receptor. The efficacy of adenoviral vectors 
      could be improved if viral vectors that exhibit tissue-specific gene delivery were 
      developed. For efficient gene transfer it is essential that every step from binding 
      of virus to target cells to transgene expression is successfully accomplished. We 
      developed a specific vector targeting the CD21 receptor, by inserting a CD21 binding 
      sequence, derived from the EBV GP350/220 protein, into the HI loop of the HAdV5 
      fiber protein. This vector, HAdV5-CD21HIloop, binds specifically to CD21-positive 
      cells and results in enhanced expression of the transgene in these cells and reduced 
      expression in CD21-negative cells. Viral infection is highly correlated with the 
      presence of CD21 receptors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that 
      HAdV5-CD21HIloop is able to transduce CD21-positive cells specifically with reduced 
      infection of nontarget cells. This is the result of the maintenance of the 
      intracellular trafficking of the genetically modified adenovirus without vesicular 
      retention, leading to enhanced nuclear transfer.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus shed in saliva is high in B-cell-tropic glycoprotein gp42.
PG  - 7281-3
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus is an orally transmitted human herpesvirus that infects 
      epithelial cells and establishes latency in memory B lymphocytes. Movement of virus 
      between the two cell types is facilitated by changes in amounts of an envelope 
      glycoprotein, gp42, which are effected by interaction of gp42 with HLA class II in a 
      B cell. Here we used the differential ability of virus to bind to CD21-positive B 
      cells and CD21-negative epithelial cells, which is also influenced by levels of 
      gp42, to determine that the majority of virus shed in saliva is derived from an HLA 
      class II-negative cell.

TI  - Resting B cells as a transfer vehicle for Epstein-Barr virus infection of epithelial 
      cells.
PG  - 7065-70
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), an orally transmitted herpesvirus, efficiently targets B 
      lymphocytes through binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp350 to the 
      complement receptor CD21. How the virus accesses epithelial cells is less well 
      understood, because such cells are largely resistant to infection with cell-free 
      virus in vitro. Here, we show that, after binding to primary B cells, most 
      Epstein-Barr virions are not internalized but remain on the B cell surface and from 
      there can transfer efficiently to CD21-negative epithelial cells, increasing 
      epithelial infection by 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold compared with cell-free virus. Transfer 
      infection is associated with the formation of B cell-epithelial conjugates with 
      gp350/CD21 complexes focused at the intercellular synapse; transfer involves the 
      gp85 and gp110 viral glycoproteins but is independent of gp42, the HLA class II 
      ligand that is essential for B cell entry. Therefore, through efficient binding to 
      the B cell surface, EBV has developed a means of simultaneously accessing both 
      lymphoid and epithelial compartments; in particular, infection of pharyngeal 
      epithelium by orally transmitted virus becomes independent of initial virus 
      replication in the B cell system.

TI  - Immunization with a DNA chimeric molecule encoding a hemagglutinin peptide and a

      influenza virus.
PG  - 1830-7
AB  - Killed viral vaccines are known to induce primarily antibody responses. By contrast 
      DNA vaccination using naked DNA encoding viral antigens induces both humoral and 
      cellular immune responses. Various approaches have been used to construct DNA 
      vaccines with build-in adjuvanticity. We hypothesized that sequences encoding a 
      common epitope of influenza A virus hemagglutinin jointed to sequences encoding a 
      single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody fragment to a costimulatory B cell 
      surface receptor would result in the in vivo expression of a chimeric viral peptide 
      with increased immunogenicity. Such a hybrid DNA molecule was constructed by us, 
      encoding a T and B cell epitope-containing influenza hemagglutinin peptide and a 
      scFv antibody fragment binding to mouse complement receptors I and II (CR1 and CR2). 
      A single immunization with a plasmid containing the described construct induced a 
      strong anti-influenza cytotoxic response lasting for more than six months and a weak 
      antibody response.

TI  - Identification of CD21-binding peptides with phage display and investigation of 
      binding properties of HPMA copolymer-peptide conjugates.
PG  - 514-23
AB  - Cancer targeting with peptides has become promising with the emergence of 
      combinatorial peptide techniques such as phage display. Using phage display under 
      stringent screening conditions, we selected five distinct peptides that specifically 
      recognized the CD21 receptor, a cell surface marker of malignant B cell lymphoma. 
      Two highly hydrophobic sequences were excluded (RLAYWCFSGLFLLVC and 
      PVAAVSFVPYLVKTY). The binding affinity toward CD21 of the other three selected 
      peptides (RMWPSSTVNLSAGRR, PNLDFSPTCSFRFGC, and GRVPSMFGGHFFFSR) was analyzed with 
      fluorescence quenching. Their dissociation constants were determined to be within 
      the micromolar range. On the basis of the results of phage ELISA, competitive phage 
      ELISA, and fluorescence quenching, the binding sites of the three selected peptides 
      were found to reside within the first four short consensus repeats of CD21 (SCR1-4). 
      The peptide RMWPSSTVNLSAGRR (P1) was bound to the N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide 
      (HPMA) copolymer, a potential drug carrier for chemotherapeutic agents, and the 
      surface binding properties of HPMA copolymer-P1 conjugates were investigated. 
      Specific interactions were observed between HPMA copolymer-P1 conjugates and 
      surface-bound receptor. Binding of HPMA copolymer-P1 conjugates was directly related 
      to the amount of surface (MaxiSorp plate) bound receptor, and the binding of the 
      conjugates could be inhibited by the application of a 3-4 orders-of-magnitude excess 
      of free peptide over the peptide concentration in conjugates. The enhanced binding 
      of polymer-bound peptide was ascribed to multivalent interactions between the HPMA 
      copolymer-P1 conjugate and the surface-bound CD21 receptor.

      variable immunodeficiency patients.
PG  - 373-9
AB  - Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is primary hypogammaglobulinaemia with an 
      unknown aetiopathogenesis. Although various abnormalities of T and B cells have been 
      described, their pathogenetic roles are unclear. We determined T and B lymphocyte 
      subsets known to be abnormal in CVID in order to disclose possible relations between 
      numerical abnormalities in those cells. Markers associated with B cell development 
      (CD21, CD27, IgM, IgD) were determined on B lymphocytes (CD19+); T lymphocyte 
      development (CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L) and activation markers (CD25, CD27, CD28, CD29, 
      CD38, CD57, HLA-DR) were determined on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 42 CVID 
      patients and in 33 healthy controls. Abnormalities in CD4+ T lymphocyte activation 
      markers (increase in CD29, HLA-DR, CD45RO, decrease in CD27, CD62L, CD45RA) were 
      observed particularly in patients with a decreased number of memory (CD27+) and 
      mature (CD21+) B cells (group Ia according to the Freiburg group's classification), 
      while abnormalities observed in CD8+ cells (increase in CD27 and CD28 and decrease 
      in HLA-DR, CD57 and CD38) did not depend upon grouping patients together according 
      to B lymphocyte developmental subpopulations. We observed correlations between 
      immature B cells (IgM+ CD21-) and expression of CD27, CD62L, CD45RA, CD45RO and 
      HLA-DR on CD4+ T cells in CVID patients but not in the control group. The expression 
      of CD27 and CD45RA on CD4+ T lymphocytes, such as the percentage of IgD+ CD27- and 
      IgD+ CD27+ cells in B lymphocytes, showed age dependency to be more significant than 
      in the control group. Our study demonstrates that T and B lymphocyte abnormalities 
      in CVID are partially related to each other. Some of those abnormalities are not 
      definite, but may evolve with age of the patient.

TI  - Complement component C3d-antigen complexes can either augment or inhibit B 
      lymphocyte activation and humoral immunity in mice depending on the degree of 
      CD21/CD19 complex engagement.
PG  - 8011-23
AB  - C3d can function as a molecular adjuvant by binding CD21 and thereby enhancing B 
      cell activation and humoral immune responses. However, recent studies suggest both 
      positive and negative roles for C3d and the CD19/CD21 signaling complex in 
      regulating humoral immunity. To address whether signaling through the CD19/CD21 
      complex can negatively regulate B cell function when engaged by physiological 
      ligands, diphtheria toxin (DT)-C3d fusion protein and C3dg-streptavidin (SA) 
      complexes were used to assess the role of CD21 during BCR-induced activation and in 
      vivo immune responses. Immunization of mice with DT-C3d3 significantly reduced 
      DT-specific Ab responses independently of CD21 expression or signaling. By contrast, 
      SA-C3dg tetramers dramatically enhanced anti-SA responses when used at low doses, 
      whereas 10-fold higher doses did not augment immune responses, except in 
      CD21/35-deficient mice. Likewise, SA-C3dg (1 microg/ml) dramatically enhanced 
      BCR-induced intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) responses in vitro, but 
      had no effect or inhibited [Ca2+]i responses when used at 10- to 50-fold higher 
      concentrations. SA-C3dg enhancement of BCR-induced [Ca2+]i responses required CD21 
      and CD19 expression and resulted in significantly enhanced CD19 and Lyn 
      phosphorylation, with enhanced Lyn/CD19 associations. BCR-induced CD22 
      phosphorylation and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine 
      phosphatase-1/CD22 associations were also reduced, suggesting abrogation of negative 
      regulatory signaling. By contrast, CD19/CD21 ligation using higher concentrations of 
      SA-C3dg significantly inhibited BCR-induced [Ca2+]i responses and inhibited CD19, 
      Lyn, CD22, and Syk phosphorylation. Therefore, C3d may enhance or inhibit 
      Ag-specific humoral immune responses through both CD21-dependent and -independent 
      mechanisms depending on the concentration and nature of the Ag-C3d complexes.

TI  - A critical role for complement C3d and the B cell coreceptor (CD19/CD21) complex in 
      the initiation of inflammatory arthritis.
PG  - 5379-89
AB  - Complement C3 cleavage products mediate the recognition and clearance of toxic or 
      infectious agents. In addition, binding of the C3d fragment to Ag promotes B 
      lymphocyte activation through coengagment of the BCR and complement receptor 2 
      (CD21). Signal augmentation is thought to be achieved through enhanced recruitment 
      and activation of CD21-associated CD19. In this study we show, using the DBA/1 
      collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, that conjugation of C3d to heterologous type 
      II collagen is sufficient to cause disease in the absence of the mycobacterial 
      components of CFA. Transient depletion of C3 during the inductive phase of CIA 
      delays and lessens the severity of disease, and DBA/1 mice deficient for coreceptor 
      components CD19 or CD21 are not susceptible to CIA. Adoptive transfer experiments 
      revealed that CD21 expression on either B cells or follicular dendritic cells is 
      sufficient to acquire disease susceptibility. Although CD19(-/-) and CD21(-/-) mice 
      produce primary Ab responses to heterologous and autologous type II collagen, they 
      are impaired in the ability to activate T cells, form germinal centers, and produce 
      secondary autoantibody responses. These findings indicate that binding of C3d to 
      self-Ags can promote autoimmunity through enhanced Ag retention and presentation by 
      follicular dendritic cells and B cells, respectively.

TI  - Regulation of B lymphocyte activation by complement C3 and the B cell coreceptor 
      complex.
PG  - 237-43
AB  - Complement is an essential innate immune mechanism that recognizes and eradicates 
      microbes and associated toxins. In addition, complement receptors (CD21 and CD35) on 
      B cells cooperate with the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) to efficiently recognize 
      and respond to antigens bearing complement C3d(g). Fixation of C3d(g) to antigen 
      confers adjuvant properties and therefore its deposition may need to be carefully 
      regulated to avoid autoreactivity. CD21 and/or CD35 engagement is nonmitogenic, and 
      B-cell activation via BCR-CD21 coligation is enhanced through the recruitment of 
      CD19. Recent efforts have sought a better understanding of the topological and 
      biochemical properties of BCR and coreceptor (CD19-CD21-CD81) signaling, as well as 
      the context for complement activation in the response to foreign and self antigens.

TI  - Effect of hepatitis C virus coinfection on humoral immune alterations in naïve 
      HIV-infected adults on HAART: a three year follow-up study.
PG  - 296-302
AB  - Whether HAART allows complete recovery of humoral immune function in HIV-infected 
      individuals is still controversial. Our objective was to study the effect of HAART 
      on both B cell repopulation and hypergammaglobulinemia in 72 naïve patients, 
      including 35 HCV-coinfected individuals, during 156 weeks on HAART. The possible 
      role of HCV coinfection on the recovery of the humoral immune system was also 
      investigated. At baseline, HCV-coinfected patients had greater circulant IgG levels 
      than HIV-only-infected patients, while B cell count and CD21(low) B cell 
      subpopulation were similar in both groups. During HAART, HIV-only-infected patients 
      reached normal B cell counts and circulant IgG levels, while HCV-coinfected 
      individuals did not. CD21(low) B cell subpopulation significantly decreased in both 
      groups of patients at week 48 after the initiation of HAART compared to baseline. 
      Thus, B cells remained continuously stimulated in HCV-coinfected patients and this 
      stimulation seemed to be through a CD21-independent pathway.

TI  - Generalized myositis mimicking polymyositis associated with chronic active 
      Epstein-Barr virus infection.
PG  - 519-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic generalized myositis has not so far been reported as a 
      complication of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV). We encountered 
      three patients with chronic generalized myositis mimicking polymyositis associated 
      with CAEBV. METHODS: To clarify the pathological character of this myositis, we 
      investigated the distribution, clonality, and the immunophenotype of EBV-infected 
      cells and lymphocytes infiltrating in muscles. RESULTS: Clinically, two patients 
      showed symmetrical proximal weakness and muscle atrophy as the initial and main 
      symptom. Although the condition resembled polymyositis, they had also lingual and/or 
      orbital myositis. The other patient showed generalized myositis at the late phase of 
      CAEBV. In all of them, immunotherapy was ineffective and prognosis was poor. 
      Intramuscular infiltrating lymphocytes in our patients were mainly CD45RO+, CD3+, 
      CD4-, CD8-, TCR betaF1-, TCR deltaTCS1-, CD56-, CD79a-, CD21-, HLA-DR+, ZEBRA -, 
      LMP1-, and EBER+ T cells. Oligoclonal expansion of EBV-infected T cells was shown in 
      the muscles. However, there were no malignant lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This new 
      form of myositis must be distinguished from polymyositis and the other conventional 
      forms of myositis. Careful investigation of hidden CAEBV is recommended when 
      patients present with steroid non-responsive chronic progressive generalized 
      myositis, in particular, with lingual or orbital involvement.

      conjugate vaccines.
PG  - 322-8
AB  - The immune response to polysaccharides is initiated when polysaccharides bind 
      complement factor C3d, and these polysaccharide-C3d complexes subsequently localize 
      on splenic marginal zone B cells strongly expressing CD21 (complement receptor 2). 
      Infants and children under the age of 2 years have low or absent expression of CD21 
      on their marginal zone B cells, and consequently do not adequately respond to 
      polysaccharides. In contrast, polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are able to 
      induce antibodies at this young age. Conjugate vaccines apparently overcome the 
      necessity for CD21-C3d interaction for an antipolysaccharide immune response. We 
      demonstrate in a rat model that localization of pneumococcal polysaccharides on 
      splenic marginal zone B cells indeed is complement dependent. We also show that 
      pneumococcal conjugates do not specifically localize on splenic marginal zone B 
      cells and that splenic localization of polysaccharide conjugates is independent of 
      the presence of complement. Thus, the induction of antipolysaccharide antibodies by 
      conjugate vaccines apparently can occur independently of CD21-C3d interaction. These 
      basic findings may explain the effectiveness of conjugated vaccines in young 
      children and may open the way for their application in other patient groups.

TI  - Complement receptors regulate differentiation of bone marrow plasma cell precursors 
      expressing transcription factors Blimp-1 and XBP-1.
PG  - 993-1005
AB  - Humoral immune responses are thought to be enhanced by complement-mediated 
      recruitment of the CD21-CD19-CD81 coreceptor complex into the B cell antigen 
      receptor (BCR) complex, which lowers the threshold of B cell activation and 
      increases the survival and proliferative capacity of responding B cells. To 
      investigate the role of the CD21-CD35 complement receptors in the generation of B 
      cell memory, we analyzed the response against viral particles derived from the 
      bacteriophage Qbeta in mice deficient in CD21-CD35 (Cr2(-/-)). Despite highly 
      efficient induction of early antibody responses and germinal center (GC) reactions 
      to immunization with Qbeta, Cr2(-/-) mice exhibited impaired antibody persistence 
      paralleled by a strongly reduced development of bone marrow plasma cells. 
      Surprisingly, antigen-specific memory B cells were essentially normal in these mice. 
      In the absence of CD21-mediated costimulation, Qbeta-specific post-GC B cells failed 
      to induce the transcriptional regulators Blimp-1 and XBP-1 driving plasma cell 
      differentiation, and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, which resulted in failure to 
      generate the precursor population of long-lived plasma cells residing in the bone 
      marrow. These results suggest that complement receptors maintain antibody responses 
      by delivery of differentiation and survival signals to precursors of bone marrow 
      plasma cells.

TI  - [Common variable immunodeficiency with autoimmune manifestations: study of nine 
      cases; interest of a peripheral B-cell compartment analysis in seven patients].
PG  - 95-102
AB  - PURPOSE: Autoimmune manifestations (AIM) are associated to common variable 
      immunodeficiency (CVI) in about 20 to 25% of the cases. This study presents the 
      clinical, biological characteristics and the evolution of nine patients developing 
      CVI and AIM. A peripheral B-cell compartment analysis has been performed in seven 
      cases. METHOD: This multicenter retrospective study analyses nine patients, six men 
      and three women, within a population of 32 CVI. RESULTS: The mean age was 27 years 
      at the time of diagnosis of AIM and 30 years at the time of diagnosis of CVI. The 
      diagnosis of AIM preceded the diagnosis of CVI in five cases. Thirteen AIM of 
      different types were observed: autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA, 3), immune 
      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, 2), Evan's syndrome (2), primary biliary cirrhosis 
      (1), rheumatoid arthritis (1), alopecia totalis (1), myasthenia gravis (1). The 
      peripheral B-cell compartment was investigated in seven patients: five patients with 
      autoimmune cytopenia presented with a diminution of memory B cells (CD27+IgD-) and 
      immature B cells (CD21-) levels; the patient with primary biliary cirrhosis and 
      myasthenia gravis had only a diminution of memory B cells level; the last patient 
      with ITP presented with a normal level of memory B cells. Five among the seven 
      patients with autoimmune cytopenia required a specific treatment using 
      corticosteroids, high dosages of intravenous immunoglobulin, then splenectomy after 
      failure of the medical management, with severe infectious complications in one case. 
      CONCLUSION: The association of AIM and CVI is not fortuitous. The most common AIM is 
      autoimmune cytopenia. The peripheral B-cell compartment analyses show that a 
      majority of patients have a defect in memory B-cells. Treatment regimens are not 
      standardized and splenectomy increases the risk of infectious complications.

TI  - CD22: a multifunctional receptor that regulates B lymphocyte survival and signal 
      transduction.
PG  - 1-50
AB  - Recent advances in the study of CD22 indicate a complex role for this transmembrane 
      glycoprotein member of the immunoglobulin superfamily in the regulation of B 
      lymphocyte survival and proliferation. CD22 has been previously recognized as a 
      potential lectin-like adhesion molecule that binds alpha2,6-linked sialic 
      acid-bearing ligands and as an important regulator of B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) 
      signaling. However, genetic studies in mice reveal that some CD22 functions are 
      regulated by ligand binding, whereas other functions are ligand-independent and may 
      only require expression of an intact CD22 cytoplasmic domain at the B-cell surface. 
      Until recently, most of the functional activity of CD22 has been widely attributed 
      to CD22's ability to recruit potent intracellular phosphatases and limit the 
      intensity of BCR-generated signals. However, a more complex role for CD22 has 
      recently emerged, including a central role in a novel regulatory loop controlling 
      the CD19/CD21-Src-family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) amplification pathway that 
      regulates basal signaling thresholds and intensifies Src-family kinase activation 
      after BCR ligation. CD22 is also central to the regulation of peripheral B-cell 
      homeostasis and survival, the promotion of BCR-induced cell cycle progression, and 
      is a potent regulator of CD40 signaling. Herein we discuss our current understanding 
      of how CD22 governs these complex and overlapping processes, how alterations in 
      these tightly controlled regulatory activities may influence autoimmune disease, and 
      the current and future applications of CD22-directed therapies in oncology and 
      autoimmunity.

TI  - The CD19-CD21 signal transduction complex of B lymphocytes regulates the balance 
      between health and autoimmune disease: systemic sclerosis as a model system.
PG  - 55-90
AB  - Cell-surface CD19 functions as a general rheostat for defining intrinsic and antigen 
      receptor-induced signaling thresholds critical for clonal expansion of the B cell 
      pool and humoral immunity. CD19 also governs B cell responses initiated through the 
      CD21 receptor, where complement C3d binding to CD21 links humoral immune responses 
      with the innate immune system. Alterations in this signaling pathway can predispose 
      mice and humans to autoantibody production and systemic autoimmunity. Transgenic 
      mice that overexpress CD19 by 20-170% lose tolerance and generate autoantibodies. 
      Likewise, B cells from CD21-deficient mice overexpress CD19 by approximately 50%, 
      which leads to autoantibody production. Autoimmune patients with systemic sclerosis 
      also overexpress CD19 by approximately 20%, which may contribute to their intrinsic 
      B cell abnormalities and autoantibody production. Thus, chronic B cell activation 
      resulting from augmented CD19 expression or signaling through the CD19 pathway may 
      reveal a prototype autoimmune disease susceptibility pathway in mice and humans.

TI  - Role of CD21 antigen in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and its clinical significance.
PG  - 416-24
AB  - Recent advances in immunological and molecular technology have prompted proposals to 
      change tumour classification and treatment strategies. Cell surface antigens are now 
      easy to access, and tumour origins and clinical characteristics are now readily 
      identifiable. However, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), one of the 
      heterogeneous forms of haematological malignancy, the clinical significance of 
      tumour surface antigens has not been well documented. We analysed the tumour surface 
      antigens of 50 tumours from newly diagnosed DLBCL patients by flow cytometry in 
      accordance with their clinical characteristics and followed the patients for a 
      median 3.7 years. Statistical analysis showed that CD21 expression was significantly 
      negatively associated with mortality in DLBCL (CD21 negative versus positive; 
      relative risk = 2.36, P < 0.05). As a result of these clinical observations, we 
      generated CD21-overexpressed (CD21(+)) lymphoma cell lines after gene transfection 
      and analysed tumour cell growth in vivo in immunocompromised mice. Mice challenged 
      with vector-only transfectants and parental cells as controls died within 50 d. In 
      contrast, mice injected with CD21(+) transfectants exhibited significantly reduced 
      tumour growth and 83% survived long term (versus control groups; P < 0.05). 
      Interestingly, all established CD21(+) transfectants (six clones from different 
      bulks) showed homotypic aggregation during in vitro cell culture, and anti-CD21 
      antibodies did not block this aggregation. Expression of CD21 is strongly associated 
      with increased survival in DLBCL in vivo. CD21 expression may be indirectly 
      concerned with the expression of additional cell adhesion molecules.

TI  - B-cell subsets in blood and lymphoid organs in Macaca fascicularis.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) are widely used animal models 
      in biomedical research. However, the phenotypic characteristics of cynomolgus monkey 
      (CM) B cells in peripheral blood (PB) and lymphoid organs are poorly understood. 
      METHODS: FACS analyses of PB-, spleen-, lymph node (LN)-, and bone marrow 
      (BM)-derived B cells were performed. RESULTS: CM peripheral blood B cells have a 
      smaller fraction of CD27(-) (naive) cells ( approximately 40%), as compared to human 
      blood samples ( approximately 70%). Similar to humans, an early activation marker, 
      CD23, is expressed more on CD27(-) CM naive B cells, as compared to CD27(+) B cells. 
      The mean fraction of B cells exhibiting a memory phenotype is similar to that seen 
      in human blood. Unlike humans, CM blood contains a subset of 
      CD20(++)CD80(+)CD21(-)IgM(+/-)CD27(+)CD19(+)FSC(++)BAFF-R(low) B cells that are 
      likely of germinal center origin. Thus, CM blood contains (i) a higher percentage of 
      B cells that express the co-stimulatory molecule CD80, and (ii) a lower fraction of 
      B cells that are CD21(+), as compared to human blood. Due to the relative paucity of 
      information on B-cell subsets in organs of healthy humans, a direct comparison 
      between human and CM lymphoid organ data is limited. The fraction of CD27(+) and 
      CD23(+) B cells appears to be similar, while the fraction of CD80(+) B cells appears 
      to be higher than that seen in human lymphoid organs. CM spleens and to some extent 
      lymph nodes have a distinct subset of CD21(++) cells that are also 
      CD80(+/-)CD23(low)IgM(++)CD27(+/-)FSC(++). This subset is phenotypically similar to 
      the marginal zone B cells present in human spleen and LN samples. We also provide 
      detailed analyses on the fraction of lymphoid organ B cells that express CD21, CD23, 
      CD32, and/or CD80 B-cell markers. CONCLUSIONS: In general, cynomolgus monkey B-cell 
      subsets are similar to those seen in humans, as well as to those seen in other 
      nonhuman primates. However, there are some clear differences between human and 
      cynomolgus monkey B-cell subsets. These findings have direct implications for a 
      variety of in vivo studies in cynomolgus monkeys, ranging from basic research on 
      primate B-cell differentiation to models of infectious diseases and trials of new 
      B-cell targeting therapeutic agents.

TI  - [Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the knee occurring 70 years after tuberculous 
      arthritis].
PG  - 304-7
AB  - A 72-year-old woman presented with a progressive swollen and painful left knee over 
      a period of a month. The patient had a history of tuberculous arthritis of the left 
      knee joint at the age of 1-2 years. Since then the knee showed a deformity and 
      contraction. MRI scan demonstrated a soft tissue tumor measuring 7 x 8 x 6 cm in the 
      front of the knee, a biopsy specimen taken from which revealed large B-cell 
      lymphoma. The tumor cells showed a phenotype of CD3- CD5- CD10- CD20+ CD21- BCL2+, 
      and surface immunoglobulin M-kappa. Since the lymphoma cells were found to be 
      negative for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA by means of in situ hybridization, the 
      DLBCL in this patient was thought to be caused by a different mechanism from 
      pyothorax-associated lymphoma. The patient was treated with chemotherapy (CHOP) 
      followed by radiotherapy, and obtained partial remission. There is no evidence of 
      progression seven months after diagnosis.

TI  - A naturally derived gastric cancer cell line shows latency I Epstein-Barr virus 
      infection closely resembling EBV-associated gastric cancer.
PG  - 330-6
AB  - In a process seeking out a good model cell line for Epstein-Barr virus 
      (EBV)-associated gastric cancer, we found that one previously established gastric 
      adenocarcinoma cell line is infected with type 1 EBV. This SNU-719 cell line from a 
      Korean patient expressed cytokeratin without CD19 or CD21 expression. In SNU-719, 
      EBNA1 and LMP2A were expressed, while LMP1 and EBNA2 were not. None of the tested 
      lytic EBV proteins were detected in this cell line unless stimulated with phorbol 
      ester. EBV infection was also shown in the original carcinoma tissue of SNU-719 cell 
      line. Our results support the possibility of a CD21-independent EBV infection of 
      gastric epithelial cells in vivo. As the latent EBV gene expression pattern of 
      SNU-719 closely resembles that of the EBV-associated gastric cancer, this naturally 
      derived cell line may serve as a valuable model system to clarify the precise role 
      of EBV in gastric carcinogenesis.

TI  - [CD21-independent infection of a human signet ring cell gastric carcinoma cell line 
      by Epstein-Barr virus].
PG  - 59-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of gastric carcinoma 
      cells. METHODS: The authors tested the infection of a signet ring cell line HSC-39 
      derived from human gastric carcinoma with Akata and P3HR-1 strains of EBV. Akata and 
      P3HR-1 infected of EBV cell clones were isolated by a limiting dilution method. 
      RESULTS: EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) were expressed in the infected cells with 
      each EBV strain by in situ hybridization. The EBV infected parental cells and most 
      clones expressed EBNA1, but not EBNA2, latent membrane protein (LMP) 1 and LMP2A. 
      Both EBV strains infected parental cells and clones presented type I latency. The 
      uninfected HSC-39 cells were negative for CD21 expression; however, the Akata but 
      not P3HR-1-infected clones were positive for CD21 expression at mRNA level. 
      CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that EBV infecting HSC-39 by CD21-independent 
      pathway. This study also defined a signet ring cell line as a new target for EBV.

TI  - The tetraspanin CD81 is necessary for partitioning of coligated CD19/CD21-B cell 
      antigen receptor complexes into signaling-active lipid rafts.
PG  - 370-80
AB  - Tetraspanins have been hypothesized to facilitate the organization of functional 
      multimolecular membrane complexes. In B cells the tetraspanin CD81 is a component of 
      the CD19/CD21 complex. When coligated to the B cell Ag receptor (BCR), the CD19/CD21 
      complex significantly enhances BCR signaling in part by prolonging the association 
      of the BCR with signaling-active lipid rafts. In this study CD81 is shown to 
      associate with lipid rafts upon coligation of the BCR and the CD19/CD21 complex. 
      Using B cells from CD81-deficient mice we demonstrate that in the absence of CD81, 
      coligated BCR and CD19/CD21 complexes fail to partition into lipid rafts and enhance 
      BCR signaling from rafts. Furthermore, a chimeric CD19 protein that associates only 
      weakly if at all with CD81 fails to promote the association of coligated BCR with 
      lipid rafts. The requirement for CD81 to promote lipid raft association may define a 
      novel mechanism by which tetraspanins function as molecular facilitators of 
      signaling receptors.

TI  - Complement receptors type 1 (CR1, CD35) and 2 (CR2, CD21) cooperate in the binding 
      of hydrolyzed complement factor 3 (C3i) to human B lymphocytes.
PG  - 3311-21
AB  - The C3b-binding receptor, CR1/CD35, supports CR2/CD21-mediated activation of 
      complement by human B lymphocytes, possibly by associating with CR2 to promote or 
      stabilize the binding of hydrolyzed C3 (C3i), the primary component of the AP 
      convertase, C3i-Bb. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the uptake kinetics and 
      binding equilibria for C3i dimer interaction with human blood cells in the absence 
      and presence of CR1- and CR2-blocking mAb. C3i displayed dual uptake kinetics to B 
      lymphocytes, comprising of rapid binding to CR1 and slower binding to CR2. The 
      forward rate constants (k(1)) for CR1 and CR2, operating independently, differed ca. 
      9-fold (k(1)=193+/-9.4 and 22.2+/-6.0 x 10(3) M(-1)s(-1), respectively). Equilibrium 
      binding of C3i to B lymphocytes was also complex, varying in strength by ca. 13-fold 
      over the C3i concentration range examined. The maximum association constant (K(a, 
      max)=109+/-27.2 x 10(7) l/mole) was ca. 9- and 6-fold greater, respectively, than 
      those for CR1 or CR2 acting alone (K(a)=13.2+/-5.3 and 18.5+/-3.5 x 10(7) l/mole). 
      The high avidity of the CR1-CR2 complex for C3i is consistent with its rates of C3i 
      uptake and release being determined by CR1 and CR2, respectively.

TI  - Detection of two cell populations corresponding to distinct maturation stages in 
      API-2/MLT-positive mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma cells proliferating in 
      pleural effusion.
PG  - 357-61
AB  - A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of an intra-abdominal tumor 
      and pleural effusion (PE). Immunoelectrophoresis of the serum showed immunoglobulin 
      M (IgM) kappa paraprotein (7330 mg/dL). Abnormal plasmacytoid cells were seen in 
      both the peripheral blood (PB) and the bone marrow (BM). Computed tomography scans 
      showed extensive thickening of the gastric wall and bilateral massive PE without 
      lymph node or pulmonary involvement. A histologic examination of the gastric mucosa 
      showed a diffuse infiltration of small- to medium-sized lymphoid CD20-bearing cells, 
      some of which showed a plasmacytoid morphology. Lymphoepithelial lesions were 
      demonstrated with an immunohistochemical stain. The diagnosis was gastric 
      mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma infiltrating to the PE, PB, and 
      BM. The PE contained numerous lymphoid cells with plasmacytoid morphology that 
      Southern blotting analysis showed to have a monoclonal IgH gene rearrangement 
      pattern. The cells seemed to be divided into two populations according to their 
      surface markers: mature B-cells (CD19+CD20+CD22+CD21+CD38-) and secretory B-cells 
      (CD19+CD20(dim)CD22-CD21-CD38+). The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 
      technique detected the API-2/MLT transcript in the PE and PB. The patient had a good 
      response to fludarabine treatment, which was followed with rituximab therapy. In 
      general, gastric MALT lymphoma cells have a tendency to differentiate into plasma 
      cells. In this article, we show that the cell character of API-2/MLT-positive MALT 
      lymphoma is preserved even when the cells are disseminated. This is the first 
      published case, to our knowledge, in which two differentiation stages of MALT 
      lymphoma cells infiltrating into PE have been confirmed by flow cytometric analysis.

TI  - The tetraspanin CD81 regulates the expression of CD19 during B cell development in a 
      postendoplasmic reticulum compartment.
PG  - 4062-72
AB  - CD81 is a widely expressed tetraspanin that associates in B cells with CD19 in the 
      CD19-CD21-CD81 signaling complex. CD81 is necessary for normal CD19 expression; 
      cd81(-/-) B cells express lower levels of CD19, especially cd81(-/-) small pre-BII 
      cells, which are almost devoid of surface CD19. The dependence of CD19 expression on 
      CD81 is specific to this particular tetraspanin since cd9(-/-) B cells express 
      normal levels of CD19. Furthermore, expression of human CD81 in mouse cd81(-/-) B 
      cells restored surface CD19 to normal levels. Quantitative analysis of CD19 mRNA 
      demonstrated normal levels, even in cd81(-/-) pre-BII cells. Analysis of CD19 at the 
      protein level identified two CD19 glycoforms in both wild-type and cd81(-/-) B 
      cells. The higher M(r) glycoform is significantly reduced in cd81(-/-) B cells and 
      is endoglycosidase H (endo-H) resistant. In contrast, the low M(r) glycoform is 
      comparably expressed in cd81(-/-) and in wild-type B cells and is endo-H sensitive. 
      Because endo-H sensitivity is tightly correlated with endoplasmic reticulum 
      localization, we suggest that the dependency of CD19 expression on CD81 occurs in a 
      postendoplasmic reticulum compartment where CD81 is necessary for normal trafficking 
      or for surface membrane stability of CD19.

TI  - B cell activation leads to shedding of complement receptor type II (CR2/CD21).
PG  - 2391-7
AB  - Complement receptor type II (CR2/CD21) is the major receptor for C3d fragments on 
      immune complexes. CD21 also serves as the receptor for Epstein-Barr virus in humans. 
      On mature B cells, CD21 reduces the threshold of BCR signaling together with CD81, 
      Leu13 and CD19, but it also occurs on other cells of the immune system where it 
      performs unknown functions. A soluble form of CD21 (sCD21) is shed from the cell 
      surface and is found in human blood plasma. An as-yet-unknown protease is thought to 
      be responsible for this shedding. Altered levels of sCD21 occur in plasma in certain 
      clinical conditions. We show here by mass spectrometry that sCD21 in human plasma of 
      healthy donors is predominantly a short form of CD21 without the exon-11-encoded 
      sequences. Whereas the N terminus of sCD21 was found unmodified, the C terminus is 
      truncated, implying that only the extracellular portion of CD21 is shed. Peripheral 
      blood B cells, but not T cells, contribute to the plasma CD21-pool. CD21 shedding is 
      induced by stimulation with PMA plus Ca(2+) ionophore, or by stimulation of the BCR 
      with anti-IgM+anti-CD40.

TI  - Effect of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, Rituxan, on cynomolgus monkey and human B 
      cells in a whole blood matrix.
PG  - 101-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cynomolgus monkeys are widely used animal models in biomedical research. 
      The differences between cynomolgus monkey and human B cells are not completely 
      understood. However, these differences are of crucial importance for interpretation 
      of data from studies on new therapeutic agents aimed at B-cell depletion, such as 
      anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. METHODS: Multicolor fluorescence-activated cell 
      sorting analysis of peripheral blood B cells was performed on samples treated ex 
      vivo with the anti-CD20 therapeutic monoclonal antibody, Rituxan, in a whole blood 
      matrix. RESULTS: In contrast to humans, cynomolgus monkeys had two distinct B-cell 
      subsets, CD20highCD40lowCD21- and CD20lowCD40highCD21+. These B-cell subsets had a 
      2.5-fold difference in the EC50 for Rituxan binding and differed significantly in 
      their in vitro susceptibility to Rituxan depletion. Human B cells were similar to 
      the CD20lowCD40highCD21+ cynomolgus monkey B cells with regard to their EC50 for 
      Rituxan and response to Rituxan in a whole blood matrix assay. CD21 was upregulated, 
      whereas CD40 was downregulated at incubation with Rituxan in the 
      CD20lowCD40highCD21+ monkey and human B cells in a concentration-dependent manner. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings have direct implications for in vivo studies of 
      therapeutic agents that target B cells in cynomolgus monkeys and for extrapolation 
      of the results to humans. In addition, our data are consistent with the model in 
      which CD20, CD21, and CD40 exist in a supramolecular complex that is affected by 
      anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.

TI  - Binding and cytotoxicity of HPMA copolymer conjugates to lymphocytes mediated by 
      receptor-binding epitopes.
PG  - 360-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Studies on the recognition of epitopes presented on a template peptide 
      showed the potential of nonapeptide-related sequences to act as biorecognition sites 
      for the B-cell CD21 receptor. This study was intended to evaluate the capability of 
      three epitope sequences to mediate specific cell binding and to enhance the 
      cytotoxicity of HPMA copolymer conjugates. METHODS: HPMA copolymer conjugates were 
      synthesized containing three different epitopes at various contents and either a 
      fluorescent marker or doxorubicin (DOX). The binding and cytotoxicity of the 
      conjugates to CD21+ Raji B cells and CD21- HSB-2 T cells were evaluated. RESULTS: 
      The epitope-containing conjugates were found to bind to Raji cells at different 
      apparent affinities depending on epitope structure and content. The conjugates 
      generally possessed higher affinities for Raji cells than for HSB-2 cells. Targeted 
      HPMA copolymer-DOX conjugates exhibited higher cytotoxicities than the nontargeted 
      conjugate, likely indicative of enhanced internalization by receptor-mediated 
      endocytosis. HSB-2 cells were more sensitive to both free and polymer-bound DOX than 
      Raji cells; however, the enhancement of cytotoxicity of the conjugates by 
      incorporation of epitopes was more pronounced for Raji cells. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results verified the concept of using receptor-binding epitopes as targeting 
      moieties in HPMA copolymer conjugates for the delivery of anticancer drugs to 
      lymphoma cells.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus infection of polarized tongue and nasopharyngeal epithelial 
      cells.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) initially enters the body through the oropharyngeal mucosa 
      and subsequently infects B lymphocytes through their CD21 (CR2) complement receptor. 
      Mechanisms of EBV entry into and release from epithelial cells are poorly 
      understood. To study EBV infection in mucosal oropharyngeal epithelial cells, we 
      established human polarized tongue and pharyngeal epithelial cells in culture. We 
      show that EBV enters these cells through three CD21-independent pathways: (i) by 
      direct cell-to-cell contact of apical cell membranes with EBV-infected lymphocytes; 
      (ii) by entry of cell-free virions through basolateral membranes, mediated in part 
      through an interaction between beta1 or alpha5beta1 integrins and the EBV BMRF-2 
      protein; and (iii) after initial infection, by virus spread directly across lateral 
      membranes to adjacent epithelial cells. Release of progeny virions from polarized 
      cells occurs from both their apical and basolateral membranes. These data indicate 
      that multiple approaches to prevention of epithelial infection with EBV will be 
      necessary.

TI  - Massive hyperplasia of marginal zone B-cells with clear cytoplasm in the lymph node: 
      a case report.
PG  - 625-8
AB  - An enlarged axillary lymph node from a 63-year-old woman showed proliferating 
      marginal zone B-cells arranged in a vague nodular pattern or in band-forming 
      aggregates throughout the cortex. Marginal zone B-cells, which also infiltrated the 
      adjacent fatty tissue, had round or slightly indented nuclei of medium size and a 
      moderate amount of clear cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, these cells were CD20+, 
      CD79a+, Bcl-2+, sIgD-, CD5-, CD10-, CD21-, CD23-, CD45RO-, Bcl-6-, and cyclin D-. A 
      portion of the cells were sIgM- and CD43-positive. The polytypic nature of these 
      cells was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction. 
      Systemic bacterial infection appears to be the cause of marginal zone B-cell 
      hyperplasia. This unusual marginal zone B-cell hyperplasia should be differentiated 
      from low-grade B cell lymphomas, and particularly from nodal marginal zone B-cell 
      lymphomas.

TI  - Classical Hodgkin lymphoma occurring in clusters of nodal marginal zone 
      B-lymphocytes in association with progressive transformation of germinal center. A 
      case report.
PG  - 547-50
AB  - We present a case of a classical Hodgkin lymphoma occurring in clusters of marginal 
      zone B-lymphocytes (MZBLs). Most lymphoid follicles possessed hyperplastic germinal 
      centers, while a portion of the follicles exhibited a progressive transformation of 
      the germinal center (PTGC). Clusters of MZBLs showed a perifollicular distribution. 
      The classic Reed-Sternberg cells were found in clusters of MZBLs. A portion of the 
      Reed-Sternberg cells were CD15+, CD20+, CD30+, CD79a+, fascin+, vimentin+, EMA-, and 
      bcl-2-. Some Reed-Sternberg cells were surrounded by CD3+ CD45RO+ CD57-rosettes. In 
      situ hybridization studies demonstrated strong expression of EBER in classic 
      Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants. The overall morphological, 
      immunohistological, and EBV findings confirmed that the present case is a classical 
      Hodgkin lymphoma. The MZBLs were CD20+, CD79a+, sIgM+/-, sIgD-, CD5-, CD21-, CD43-, 
      CD45RO-, and Bcl-2-. Some MZBLs had polytypic intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin. 
      Problems arising in the differential diagnosis between lymphocyte-predominant 
      Hodgkin lymphoma and PTGC have been described. An occasional association between 
      MZBLs clusters and PTGC has been reported previously. This case suggests that 
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma should be added to the differential diagnosis of PTGC.

TI  - Disappearance of CD21-positive follicular dendritic cells preceding the 
      transformation of follicular lymphoma: immunohistological study of the 
      transformation using CD21, p53, Ki-67, and P-glycoprotein.
PG  - 293-302
AB  - Some follicular lymphomas histologically transform into diffuse aggressive 
      lymphomas, the prognosis of which is poor. There are, however, no reliable 
      histological criteria for predicting which cases will later undergo such 
      transformation. In low-grade B-cell lymphomas, follicular dendritic cells form dense 
      mesh-like networks that contain accumulating neoplastic B-cells. These are rare in 
      high-grade lymphomas. We immunohistochemically analyzed CD21-positive follicular 
      dendritic cells in 32 follicular lymphomas, including 3 transformed lymphomas, in 
      addition to immunohistological study using P-glycoprotein, p53, and Ki-67. We found 
      that the mesh-like networks in follicles are more clearly defined in low-grade 
      lymphomas than in high-grade lymphomas (p = 0.015). Neoplastic follicles in 2 
      transformed lymphomas lost the networks of follicular dendritic cells before 
      transformation despite the existence of morphologically clear follicles. This 
      differed from the non-transformed cases of the same cytological grades. Prognosis 
      was statistically better for patients with low-grade tumor than for those with 
      high-grade tumor (p = 0.026), and there was a trend toward poorer survival among 
      CD21-negative cases (p = 0.186). P-glycoprotein, p53, and Ki-67 expressions did not 
      provide sufficient information to predict the transformation of follicular lymphoma. 
      The presence of CD21-positive follicular dendritic cells in neoplastic follicles 
      might help predict the potential of follicular lymphoma to transform to diffuse 
      large B-cell lymphoma.

PG  - 133-9
AB  - The phenotype of cryopreserved crossbred porcine PBMC, with special emphasis on NK 
      cell related surface markers, was characterised. The phenotype expressed prior to 
      stimulation with rHu IL2 and rHu IL12 was related to the in vitro cytotoxic capacity 
      estimated in a 4-h or 21-h 51Cr-release assay. PBMC incubated in growth medium 
      without addition of cytokines were used to investigate the spontaneous cytotoxic 
      capacity. The results of this study suggest that crossbred porcine PBMC comprise a 
      specific subset expressing the phenotype CD2+CD3-CD4-CD8+SWC3-CD16+CD21-. No 
      spontaneous cytotoxicity of the PBMC could be estimated, but the expression of CD16 
      seems to be a basic marker of the cytokine induced cytotoxic activity. This study 
      suggests that cryopreserved porcine PBMC can be used when possible influences on the 
      porcine NK cell system are investigated in relation to disease models conducted 
      experimentally in crossbred pigs.

AB  - Phenotypes of lymphocytes from laparoscopically biopsied liver tissues of eleven 
      healthy beagle dogs were analyzed. The proportion of CD3(+) lymphocytes (T cells), 
      CD3 (-)CD21(+) lymphocytes (B cells) and CD3 (-)CD21(-) lymphocytes (non-T non-B 
      lymphocytes), and the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio in the canine hepatic lymphocytes were 
      54.8 +/- 11.9%, 4.7 +/- 3.1%, 40.7 +/- 13.2%, and 0.33 +/- 0.12, respectively, while 
      those in peripheral blood lymphocytes were 85.4 +/- 6.5%, 9.3 +/- 6.1%, 5.3 +/- 
      1.8%, and 1.64 +/- 0.36, respectively. These results indicated that the constitution 
      of hepatic lymphocytes quite differed from that of peripheral blood lymphocytes in 
      dogs, and suggested that the regional immunity in canine liver might be specific.

TI  - Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma: high frequency of BCL-6 mutations and 
      consistent expression of the transcription factors OCT-2, BOB.1, and PU.1 in the 
      absence of immunoglobulins.
PG  - 243-53
AB  - Although primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma has been primarily 
      studied, its precise phenotype, molecular characteristics, and histogenesis are 
      still a matter of debate. The International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group 
      collected 137 such cases for extensive pathological review. Histologically, the 
      lymphomatous growth was predominantly diffuse with fibrosis that induced 
      compartmentalized cell aggregation. It consisted of large cells with varying degrees 
      of nuclear polymorphism and clear to basophilic cytoplasm. On immunohistochemistry, 
      the following phenotype was observed: CD45(+), CD20(+), CD79a(+), PAX5/BSAP(+), 
      BOB.1(+), Oct-2(+), PU.1(+), Bcl-2(+), CD30(+), HLA-DR(+), MAL protein(+/-), 
      Bcl-6(+/-), MUM1/IRF4(+/-), CD10(-/+), CD21(-), CD15(-), CD138(-), CD68(-), and 
      CD3(-). Immunoglobulins were negative both at immunohistochemistry and in situ 
      hybridization. Molecular analysis, performed in 45 cases, showed novel findings. 
      More than half of the cases displayed BCL-6 gene mutations, which usually occurred 
      along with functioning somatic IgV(H) gene mutations and Bcl-6 and/or MUM1/IRF4 
      expression. The present study supports the concept that a sizable fraction of cases 
      of this lymphoma are from activated germinal center or postgerminal center cells. 
      However, it differs from other aggressive B-cell lymphomas in that it shows 
      defective immunoglobulin production despite the expression of OCT-2, BOB.1, and PU.1 
      transcription factors and the lack of IgV(H) gene crippling mutations.

TI  - Detection and characterization of plasma cells in peripheral blood: correlation of 
      IgE+ plasma cell frequency with IgE serum titre.
PG  - 370-8
AB  - In atopic patients and patients with hyper-IgE syndrome (HIE) highly elevated IgE 
      serum levels can be detected. Due to their very low frequency little is known about 
      IgE-producing plasma cells (PC) in peripheral blood. We used CD138 MACS microbeads 
      to enrich plasma cells from peripheral blood of normal donors, atopic patients and 
      one HIE patient. CD138+ cells were mainly CD45+, CD44++, CD19dim, CD38++, CD27++, 
      CD86+, HLA-DR+/++, CD71dim, VLA-4+, VLA-5-, CD28-, CD25-, CD69-, CLA-, CD20-, CD21- 
      and CD22-. They show weak expression of surface Ig but high levels of intracellular 
      Ig and they secrete Ig in culture. Thus CD138+ cells from peripheral blood show 
      characteristics of early plasma cells. IgE+ CD138+ plasma cells could be detected in 
      19 of 24 normal donors with an average frequency of 0.06% IgE+ cells among CD138+ 
      cells. Higher frequencies were detected in atopic patients, atopic patients with 
      markedly elevated serum IgE levels and the hyper-IgE patient with an average of 
      0.32%, 7.21% and 6.54%, respectively. Additionally, using the recently developed 
      cellular affinity matrix technology, we were able to detect IgE secreting plasma 
      cells and thereby could demonstrate that most of the IgE secreting cells express 
      CD138. The frequency of IgE+ CD138+ cells among PBMC correlated highly significantly 
      with serum IgE titres (r = 0.8532***), indicating that IgE secreting CD138+ cells in 
      peripheral blood are directly related to the plasma cell pool contributing to the 
      IgE titre.

TI  - Regulation of IgG antibody responses by epitope density and CD21-mediated 
      costimulation.
PG  - 3305-14
AB  - Epitope density and organization have been shown to be important factors for B cell 
      activation in many animal model systems. However, it has been difficult to separate 
      the role of antigen organization from the role of local antigen concentrations 
      because highly organized antigens are usually particulate whereas non-organized 
      antigens are more soluble. Hence, highly organized and non-organized antigens may 
      interact with different cell types and in different locations within lymphoid 
      organs. In order to assess the role of antigen organization in regulating B cell 
      responses, we immunized mice with highly repetitive virus-like particles, which 
      exhibit different epitope densities covalently attached to them. Therefore, the same 
      particulate structure was used to present identical epitopes that differed in their 
      degree of organization. Induction of epitope-specific IgM titers, reflecting early B 
      cell activation, were unaffected by the degree of epitope density. Furthermore, the 
      absence of Th cells or CD21/CD35 did not reduce the IgM response. In contrast, the 
      degree of organization was a critical factor influencing the magnitude of the 
      epitope-specific IgG response. Moreover, the threshold for IgG responses was shifted 
      in the absence of CD21/CD35, resulting in the requirement for higher epitope 
      densities to allow efficient IgG responses. Thus, IgG but not IgM responses are 
      regulated by epitope density and B cell costimulatory thresholds.

TI  - Ovarian follicular lymphoma: a case report and review of the literature.
PG  - 654-8
AB  - Primary ovarian lymphoma is extremely rare, and such a case is reported here. The 
      patient was a 54-year-old Japanese female with abnormal genital bleeding. Pelvic CT 
      and MRI showed a right ovarian tumor with a diameter of 7 cm and an irregular 
      border. With the diagnosis of a right ovarian tumor, the patient underwent a simple 
      hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Microscopic examination of the 
      right ovarian tumor revealed vaguely nodular growth of small lymphoid cells. They 
      were CD10+, Bcl-2+, Cyclin D1- and CD21-, although CD21+ follicular dendritic cell 
      clusters were present as a background component in each vague nodule. A conventional 
      cytogenetic analysis revealed t(14;18)(q32;q21), and somatic hypermutation of the 
      variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) was confirmed by direct 
      sequencing of subcloned DNA samples derived from PCR amplicons. These findings led 
      us to characterize the lesion as follicular lymphoma, grade 1. The patient was free 
      of detectable disease 9 months after initiation of post-surgical chemotherapy. Since 
      the prognosis for primary ovarian lymphoma is relatively favorable in many cases, it 
      is important to establish therapeutic methods for the cure of this disease using 
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy without radical surgery.

TI  - Up-regulation by feline interleukin-4 and down-regulation by feline interferon-gamma 
      of major histocompatibility complex class II on cat B-lymphocytes.
PG  - 197-208
AB  - Interleukin-4 (IL-4) exhibits numerous biological and immunoregulatory functions on 
      B- and T-lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells in both mice and humans. In the 
      present study, we show that IL-4 also has a regulatory function in the cat species. 
      Cells transfected with IL-4 DNA expressed a biologically active protein as 
      demonstrated by the up-regulation of MHC class II molecules on B-lymphocytes 
      (CD21(+)) in a flow cytometric assay. Increased levels of MHC class II expression on 
      CD21(+) cells were seen in 11 out of 12 cats (p<0.05). In addition, 12 out of 12 
      cats showed up-regulation of MHC class II on CD21(-) cells, mainly consisting of 
      T-lymphocytes (p<0.05). In contrast, concanavalin A (ConA)-induced culture 
      supernatant from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) containing high levels 
      of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) transcripts induced down-regulation of MHC class II 
      molecules on CD21(+) cells of all samples (p<0.05). Variable results were observed 
      for CD21(-) cells incubated with ConA-conditioned medium (p=0.71). The nature of the 
      cytokine(s) responsible for these effects remains to be determined. However, the 
      fact that down-regulation of MHC class II molecules on B cells occurred in all cats 
      tested suggests that IFN-gamma may be involved. These data provide further insight 
      into the mechanism by which MHC class II expression is regulated in feline 
      lymphocytes, and suggest that the Th1/Th2 paradigm is also present in the cat.

TI  - [Sub-classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by semi-quantification of the 
      CD5 expression with flow cytometric analysis].
PG  - 906-11
AB  - CD5+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(CD5+DLBCL) is known to have different 
      characteristics than CD5-DLBCL and mantle cell lymphoma(MCL). 9 patients with 
      CD5+DLBCL were reviewed, and the results were compared with those of 8 CD5-DLBCL and 
      3 cyclin D1+MCL patients. CD5+DLBCL was more closely related to many aggressive 
      clinical features or parameters than CD5-DLBCL: 67% of the patients were older than 
      60 years, 67% with performance status > or = 2, 89% with serum lactate dehydrogenase 
      level higher than normal, 78% with stage III/IV disease at diagnosis, and 78% with 
      more than one extranodal lesion. The overall International Prognostic Index score 
      for the patients with CD5+DLBCL was thus significantly higher than that for those 
      with CD5-DLBCL. Immunophenotypically, CD5+DLBCL was characterized by 
      CD5+CD10-CD19+CD20+CD21-CD23-cyclin D1-phenotype and the predominant expression of 
      surface IgM. Of particular interest is that the survival rate of CD5+DLBCL patients 
      was significantly inferior to that of patients with CD5-DLBCL. To further 
      characterize CD5+DLBCL, we semi-quantified the CD5 expression in DLBCL cells. Our 
      findings suggest that CD5+DLBCL may constitute a unique subgroup of DLBCL and, 
      moreover, CD5+DLBCL may consist of several subgroups.

TI  - Follicular hyperplasia presenting with a marginal zone pattern in a reactive lymph 
      node lesion.
PG  - 325-31
AB  - Histologically, the marginal zone pattern of the lymph node is characterized by 
      lymphoid follicles with three distinct layers. The inner layer is composed of 
      follicular center zones, the middle layer of darkly stained mantle zones, and the 
      outer layer of marginal zones. However, the marginal zone pattern is rarely seen in 
      reactive lymph nodes except for mesenteric lymph nodes. We describe the 
      clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and genotypic findings of six cases of 
      reactive follicular hyperplasia exhibiting the marginal zone pattern. The patients 
      comprised three males and three females (age range 24 to 63 years; medium 56 years). 
      Follow-up data were obtained from five patients. None of them developed malignant 
      lymphomas during the follow-up period of from 5 to 204 months (median 68 months). 
      Histologically, the lesion was characterized by numerous lymphoid follicles and 
      partial distortion of lymph node structure. Varying degrees of progressive 
      transformation of the germinal center (PTGC) were noted in the four cases. The 
      marginal zone pattern was observed in some or most of the lymphoid follicles 
      including PTGC. The marginal zone B cells were small to medium-sized lymphocytes 
      with round or slightly indented nuclei and a broad rim of pale cytoplasm. Some of 
      them had a monocytoid appearance. They were CD20+, CD79a+, sIgM+/-, sIgD-, CD5-, 
      CD10-, CD21-, CD23-, CD43-, CD45RO-, Bcl-6-, cyclin D1-, EMA- and p53-. A portion of 
      them were Bcl-2 positive. Occasional large lymphoid cells with round or indented 
      nuclei and moderate amounts of cytoplasm were observed in the marginal zone in four 
      cases. These large lymphoid cells were usually CD20 positive, but Bcl-6 negative. A 
      small number of them contained polytypic intracytoplasmic immunoglobulins. The 
      polytypic nature of B lymphocytes was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and 
      polymerase chain reaction. Recognition of unusual marginal zone hyperplasia in 
      reactive lymph node lesions is important to avoid confusion with nodal involvement 
      in various low-grade B cell lymphomas presenting a marginal zone distribution 
      pattern.

TI  - The tyrosine kinase Lyn is required for B cell development beyond the T1 stage in 
      the spleen: rescue by over-expression of Bcl-2.
PG  - 1029-34
AB  - We have analyzed the effects of deficiency in the tyrosine kinase Lyn on B cell 
      development using transgenic mice that express a B cell antigen receptor (BCR) of 
      defined specificity (3-83,anti-H-2K(k or b)). In the absence of Lyn, immature B 
      cells are abundant in the bone marrow and spleen up until the T1 stage (IgM(hi) 
      IgD(-) CD21(-)CD23(-)), after which B cell development is severely impaired. The 
      small number of mature B cells that do develop in Lyn-deficient mice express normal 
      levels of the transgenic BCR and lack expression of CD80 and CD86, suggesting they 
      are not activated. In Lyn-deficient animals the presence of a Bcl-2 transgene leads 
      to a dramatic increase in B cell numbers and restores T2 stage (IgM(hi) IgD(hi) 
      CD21(hi) CD23(int)) and mature populations. In 3-83 lyn-/- Bcl-2 Tg mice, a 
      population of lambda-positive cells that also express the 383 idiotype is evident, 
      suggesting that in the absence of lyn isotype exclusion by the transgenic BCR is 
      less efficient. The results indicate that Lyn plays a positive role in the selection 
      and survival of mature B cells in addition to its previously documented negative 
      role in tolerance and B cell activation.

TI  - Severe deficiency of switched memory B cells (CD27(+)IgM(-)IgD(-)) in subgroups of 
      patients with common variable immunodeficiency: a new approach to classify a 
      heterogeneous disease.
PG  - 1544-51
AB  - Hypogammaglobulinemia is the hallmark of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) 
      syndrome, a heterogeneous disorder predisposing patients to recurrent bacterial 
      infections. In this study, we investigated the peripheral B-cell compartment of 30 
      well-characterized CVID patients in comparison to 22 healthy controls. Flow 
      cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed a reduction of 
      class-switched CD27(+)IgM(-)IgD(-) memory B cells below 0.4% in 77% of our patients 
      (group I), while this B-cell subpopulation exceeded 0.5% in all healthy donors and 
      in 23% of CVID patients (group II). These results correlate well with the capacity 
      of peripheral blood lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulins in vitro upon stimulation 
      with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) plus interleukin-2 because the production 
      of immunoglobulin G in vitro is entirely dependent on the presence of switched 
      memory B cells. The subdivision of group I into patients with an increased 
      proportion of CD21(-) peripheral B cells (> 20%; group Ia) and patients with normal 
      percentages of CD21(-) B cells (< 20%; group Ib) revealed a significant clustering 
      of patients with splenomegaly and autoimmune cytopenias in group Ia. Based on these 
      observations, we propose a fast and reliable new classification for CVID patients by 
      flow cytometric quantification of class-switched memory and immature B cells in the 
      peripheral blood of patients. Our results point toward defects at various stages of 
      B-cell differentiation in CVID subgroups and support the value of a B-cell-oriented 
      classification principle. A consensus on this new classification system will 
      hopefully provide a tool for rapidly defining homogeneous subgroups of CVID for 
      functional studies and genetic linkage analysis.

TI  - De novo CD5+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a clinicopathologic study of 109 
      patients.
PG  - 815-21
AB  - De novo CD5+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (CD5+ DLBCL) is known to have 
      phenotypically and genotypically different characteristics than CD5- DLBCL and 
      mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). To further characterize CD5+ DLBCL, 109 patients with 
      CD5+ DLBCL were reviewed, and the results were compared with those of 384 CD5- DLBCL 
      and 128 cyclin D1+ MCL patients. Patients with CD5+ DLBCL showed a higher age 
      distribution (median, 66 years; P =.0083) and a female predominance (male-female 
      ratio, 49:60, P =.011) compared with those with CD5- DLBCL. CD5+ DLBCL was more 
      closely associated with many aggressive clinical features or parameters than CD5- 
      DLBCL: 69% older than 60 years (P =.039), 34% with performance status greater than 1 
      (P =.0016), 69% with serum lactate dehydrogenase level higher than normal (P 
      <.0001), 62% with stage III/IV disease at diagnosis (P =.0023), 35% with more than 
      one extranodal site (P =.023), and 40% with B symptoms (P =.0031). The overall 
      International Prognostic Index score was thus significantly higher for the patients 
      with CD5+ DLBCL than for those with CD5- DLBCL (P =.00005). The most frequent site 
      of extranodal involvement was bone marrow (28%), a higher frequency than that for 
      CD5- DLBCL (P <.0001) but lower than that for cyclin D1+ MCL (P =.0015). 
      Histopathologically, CD5+ DLBCL showed centroblastic morphology except for 3 
      patients with immunoblastic disease, and interfollicular growth pattern (7%) and 
      intravascular or intrasinusoidal infiltration (19%) were observed. 
      Immunophenotypically, CD5+ DLBCL was characterized by a 
      CD5+CD10-CD19+CD20+CD21-CD23- cyclin D1- phenotype and a predominance of surface 
      IgMkappa. Of particular interest is that CD5+ DLBCL was characterized by a survival 
      curve significantly inferior to that for patients with CD5- DLBCL (P =.0026). These 
      findings suggest that CD5+ DLBCL may constitute a unique subgroup of DLBCL.

TI  - Follicular lymphoma of the salivary gland: a clinicopathological and molecular study 
      of six cases.
PG  - 287-93
AB  - To clarify the clinicopathologic, immunohistologic, and genotypic features of 
      follicular lymphoma arising from the salivary glands, we examined 20 cases of 
      operatively resected primary salivary gland lymphoma and identified 6 such cases. 
      There were 4 women and 2 men with ages ranging from 38 to 64 years (median 50 
      years). The tumor arose from the parotid gland in 4 cases and the submandibular 
      gland in the remaining 2. Four patients were stage IE and 2 were stage IIE-1. The 
      median follow-up period was 49 months and all patients were alive and well at the 
      time of going to press. Histologically, 5 patients were follicular lymphoma grade 2, 
      and 1 was grade 3. In all specimens in noninfiltrating salivary gland tissue, there 
      was periductal lymphocytic infiltration near the lymphoma. Moreover, myoepithelial 
      sialoadenitis was noted in 2 lesions. An immunohistochemical study revealed all 6 
      cases were CD10+, CD79a+, bcl-6+, CD3-, CD5-, CD21-, CD23-, and CyclinD1-. The tumor 
      cells expressed bcl-2 in 3 cases and p53 oncoprotein in 4 cases. Two cases revealed 
      clonal bands with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the immunoglobulin heavy 
      (IgH) gene. The bcl-2/IgH translocation at the major breakpoint region was detected 
      in 1 case (16%). We found a relatively high incidence of follicular lymphomas (30%) 
      in salivary gland lymphomas. Among the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) 
      system, follicular lymphomas appeared to occur frequently in the salivary glands as 
      well as the duodenum and skin. Moreover, follicular lymphoma arising from the 
      salivary glands appeared to have some of the characteristics of MALT-type lymphoma 
      including indolent prognosis, presence of myoepithelial sialoadenitis, and rarity of 
      the BCL-2 gene rearrangement.

TI  - Roles of Epstein-Barr virus glycoproteins gp350 and gp25 in the infection of human 
      epithelial cells.
PG  - 2373-2383
LID - 10.1099/0022-1317-82-10-2373 [doi]
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with various epithelial malignancies such as 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma, and causes oral hairy leukoplakia, a 
      productive EBV infection of the differentiated epithelium of the tongue. However, it 
      is not clear by what mechanism EBV infects epithelial cells. We generated a 
      recombinant EBV that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein in order to 
      monitor EBV entrance into epithelial cells quickly and quantitatively. Using this 
      monitoring system, we examined the roles of gp350 and gp25 in EBV infection of 
      epithelial cells by utilizing soluble forms of the gp350 and gp25 proteins. EBV 
      infection of three of four examined epithelial cell lines, 293, NU-GC-3 and Lovo, 
      was almost completely blocked by pretreatment of cells with a soluble form of gp350 
      (designated gp350Ig), and this blockage was dependent on the CD21-binding region of 
      gp350. On the other hand, infection of the other epithelial cell line, AGS, was not 
      inhibited at all by pretreatment with gp350Ig. Moreover, we found that a soluble 
      form of gp25 (designated gp25Ig) preferentially bound to epithelial cells rather 
      than B cells, and pretreatment of cells with gp25Ig substantially blocked EBV 
      infection of some epithelial cells. These results indicate the existence of two 
      distinct pathways in EBV infection of epithelial cells, a gp350-dependent pathway 
      and a gp350-independent pathway, and that gp25 can play a role in the infection of 
      some epithelial cells.

TI  - Lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood of dogs--a flow cytometric study.
PG  - 23-37
AB  - Slight differences in the results of papers describing lymphocyte subsets 
      distribution in the peripheral blood of healthy dogs may be explained by differences 
      in monoclonal antibody clones and sources, breed and age of animals examined, 
      methods of sample treatment, or methods of result analysis. In this paper, we 
      described the effect of sample processing and of sample storage as well as the 
      effect of age, breed, and gender of dogs on lymphocyte subset distribution. No 
      significant differences were found between samples processed following a whole-blood 
      lysis method and samples processed after density gradient separation. Furthermore, 
      no significant differences were found between samples processed within 2h after 
      collection and those stored at 4 degrees C for 12-16 h before processing. 
      Age-related changes were evident in lymphocyte subset distribution in the peripheral 
      blood of 38 Beagles divided according to their age into the six groups: (1) 5-6 
      days; (2) 2 months; (3) 6 months; (4) 1-2 years; (5) 3-5 years; and (6) >5 years. 
      The percentage of B-lymphocytes (CD21-like positive cells) in the peripheral blood 
      of newborn pups was 39.5+/-5.7 and decreased with advancing age. The percentage of 
      CD8+ lymphocytes was 7.7+/-3.4 after birth and increased with advancing age. No 
      age-related changes were observed in the percentages of CD4+ lymphocytes. The 
      CD4+:CD8+ ratio decreased with advancing age. No significant age-related change was 
      observed for lymphocytes bearing the gammadelta-TCR. Some breed differences were 
      evident. Adult (1-5-year-old) Beagles, German Shepherds, Dalmatians, and Dachshunds 
      were examined. The percentages of lymphocytes were higher in Beagles and Dachshunds 
      than in Dalmatians and German Shepherds. The highest and the lowest absolute 
      lymphocyte counts were found in Beagles and German Shepherds, respectively. As a 
      consequence, German Shepherds showed the lowest absolute counts of the individual 
      lymphocyte subpopulations and the widest neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. Dalmatians 
      showed the lowest percentage of CD3+ cells, the highest percentage of CD21+ cells, 
      and the lowest CD4+:CD8+ ratio. German Shepherds showed the lowest percentage of 
      CD21+ cells and the highest CD4+:CD8+ ratio. Females in Beagles and Dachshuns had 
      nonsignificantly higher percentages of total lymphocytes, CD3+, CD4+, and 
      nonsignificantly lower percentages of CD21+ lymphocytes. We concluded that there are 
      age-, breed-, and perhaps also gender-related differences in lymphocyte subset 
      distribution in the peripheral blood of dogs. Therefore, there is need to use 
      appropriate control group in the experimental protocols. Among-breed differences 
      could explain, at least partly, breed predisposition for some diseases.

TI  - CD19 can regulate B lymphocyte signal transduction independent of complement 
      activation.
PG  - 3190-200
AB  - B lymphocytes are critically regulated by signals transduced through the CD19-CD21 
      cell surface receptor complex, where complement C3d binding to CD21 supplies an 
      already characterized ligand. To determine the extent that CD19 function is 
      controlled by complement activation, CD19-deficient mice (that are hyporesponsive to 
      transmembrane signals) and mice overexpressing CD19 (that are hyperresponsive) were 
      crossed with CD21- and C3-deficient mice. Cell surface CD19 and CD21 expression were 
      significantly affected by the loss of CD21 and C3 expression, respectively. Mature B 
      cells from CD21-deficient littermates had approximately 36% higher cell surface CD19 
      expression, whereas CD21/35 expression was increased by approximately 45% on B cells 
      from C3-deficient mice. Negative regulation of CD19 and CD21 expression by CD21 and 
      C3, respectively, may be functionally significant because small increases in cell 
      surface CD19 overexpression can predispose to autoimmunity. Otherwise, B cell 
      development and function in CD19-deficient and -overexpressing mice were not 
      significantly affected by a simultaneous loss of CD21 expression. Although 
      CD21-deficient mice were found to express a hypomorphic cell surface CD21 protein at 
      low levels that associated with mouse CD19, C3 deficiency did not significantly 
      affect B cell development and function in CD19-deficient or -overexpressing mice. 
      These results, and the severe phenotype exhibited by CD19-deficient mice compared 
      with CD21- or C3-deficient mice, collectively demonstrate that CD19 can regulate B 
      cell signaling thresholds independent of CD21 engagement and complement activation.

TI  - Cutaneous b-cell lymphomas of follicular and marginal zone types: use of Bcl-6, 
      CD10, Bcl-2, and CD21 in differential diagnosis and classification.
PG  - 732-41
AB  - Cutaneous follicular lymphomas (FLs) and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas of extranodal 
      marginal zone (MZL)/mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type may have 
      morphologic overlap, despite the fact that they are thought to be of distinct 
      derivation (germinal center vs. postgerminal center). The problem is compounded by 
      the reported absence of bcl-2 expression by many cutaneous FLs, leading to 
      speculation that cutaneous FL may be unrelated to nodal FL. The authors analyzed the 
      expression of the germinal center-associated antigens bcl-6 and CD10 and of bcl-2 in 
      18 cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (10 FLs and eight MZLs), in relationship to CD21+ 
      follicular structures, to clarify the relationship of nodal to cutaneous FLs and to 
      explore the value of these antigens in differential diagnosis. The authors studied 
      10 cutaneous FLs (seven primary and three secondary) and eight MZLs (six primary and 
      two secondary). The FLs (found in six men and four women age 45-75 years) involved 
      the trunk (n = 3) and scalp, face and neck (n = 7). The MZLs (found in five women 
      and three men age 34-81 years) involved the trunk (n = 4), face and neck (n = 2), 
      and arm (n = 2). Immunostaining for CD21, bcl-6, CD10, and bcl-2 allowed the 
      delineation of compartments within the tumors and yielded distinct patterns of 
      staining in FL and MZL. In both follicular and interfollicular/diffuse areas of FL 
      the neoplastic cells were bcl-6+ (10 of 10), often CD10+ (seven of 10, four of seven 
      primary), and bcl-2+ (nine of 10, six of seven primary). Only three of seven cases 
      (one of five primary) had bcl-2 rearrangement detectable by polymerase chain 
      reaction. In the MZLs, the neoplastic B-cells were bcl-6-, CD10-, and bcl-2+ (eight 
      of eight). Three patterns of CD21+ follicles were identified in MZL: reactive 
      germinal centers, uniformly bcl-6+, CD10+, and bcl-2- (five of eight MZLs); 
      colonized follicles, both bcl-6-, bcl-2+, and L26+ cells, and bcl-6+ and bcl-2- 
      cells (five of eight MZLs); and expanded/colonized follicular dendritic cell 
      meshworks, bcl-6- and bcl-2+ B cells with rare residual bcl-6+ and bcl-2- cells 
      (four of eight MZLs). The authors conclude that cutaneous FLs express bcl-6 
      uniformly, usually express CD10 and bcl-2, and have a follicular pattern similar to 
      nodal FL and consistent with a germinal center origin. The immunophenotype of 
      cutaneous FL is distinct from that of cutaneous MZL, which is negative for bcl-6 and 
      CD10. Colonized follicles in MZL, identified by CD21+ follicular dendritic cell 
      meshworks, contained numerous bcl-6- and bcl-2+ B cells, and were readily 
      distinguished from neoplastic follicles in FL. Conversely, CD21- interfollicular and 
      diffuse areas in FLs contained bcl-6+ and CD10+ cells, which were not seen in 
      diffuse areas of MZLs. Thus, the combination of bcl-2, bcl-6, and CD21 staining is 
      useful for the distinction of cutaneous MZL from cutaneous FL.

TI  - Silencing of CD21 expression in synovial lymphocytes is independent of methylation 
      of the CD21 promoter CpG island.
PG  - 133-7
AB  - The complement receptor II (CD21) recognises the complement component C3d of immune 
      complexes. Expression of the CD21 gene is tightly regulated during B lymphocyte 
      differentiation. Only mature B lymphocytes express CD21 but not pro-, pre-, or 
      plasma B lymphocytes. Previously we found that pro-, pre-, and intermediate B 
      lymphocytes contain a methylated CpG island and do not express CD21. CD21-expressing 
      mature B lymphocytes, plasma B lymphocytes, and nonlymphoid cells carried a 
      demethylated CD21 CpG island. Furthermore, we found that synovial lymphocytes from 
      patients with rheumatic disease show reduced expression of CD21. This observation 
      tempted us to analyse the methylation status of the CD21 CpG island in peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells and synovial fluid mononuclear cells derived from these 
      patients. While methylation is involved in silencing CD21 in early types of B 
      lymphocytes, we found the CD21-CpG island to be demethylated in peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells and synovial fluid mononuclear cells of patient DNA.

TI  - Regulation of CD21 expression by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation.
PG  - 705-10
AB  - The complement receptor II (CD21) serves as a receptor for the complement component 
      C3d of immune complexes on B lymphocytes. Expression of the CD21 gene is tightly 
      regulated during B lymphocyte differentiation. Only mature B lymphocytes, but not 
      pro-, pre- or plasma B lymphocytes, express CD21. There is evidence that cell 
      type-specific expression is mediated by a silencer element located in the first 
      intron. The CD21 promoter region contains a CpG island adjacent to the ATG start 
      codon. We have analyzed the methylation status of this CpG island in B lymphoid cell 
      lines representing the various differentiation stages of B lymphocyte development 
      and primary lymphocytes. We found that the pro-, pre- and intermediate B lymphocytes 
      contain a methylated CpG island and do not express CD21, whereas CD21-expressing 
      mature B lymphocytes, plasma B lymphocytes and non-lymphoid cells carry a 
      demethylated CD21 CpG island. To analyze whether the lack of CD21 expression in 
      early B lymphocytes is due to inhibition by CpG methylation we have used 
      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to inhibit DNA methyltransferase activity. Treatment of pro-B 
      lymphocytes with the drug resulted in expression of CD21. We have also applied 
      Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylation, to determine whether 
      the state of histone deacetylation affects the expression of CD21. We found that TSA 
      induces expression of CD21 in early B lymphocytes. Thus CD21 expression is 
      controlled by both methylation of the CD21 CpG island and chromatin modification 
      through histone deacetylation in early B lymphocyte development.

TI  - MedB-1, a human tumor cell line derived from a primary mediastinal large B-cell 
      lymphoma.
PG  - 348-53
AB  - Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma is a locally highly aggressive but poorly 
      disseminating tumor composed of medium sized or large cells most probably of thymic 
      medullary origin. It has a mature B-cell phenotype, typically lacks immunoglobulin 
      expression and has variable defects in expression of HLA-molecules. We present here 
      a cell line, MedB-1, derived from such a tumor. As is frequently found in 
      mediastinal B-cell lymphomas in situ, MedB-1 is CD10(-), CD19(+), CD21(-), CD22(+), 
      CD23(+), CD25(-), CD37(+), CD38(-), CD39(+), CD40(+), CD54(+), CD95(+). Like the 
      parental tumor, MedB-1 lacks HLA-A,B,C alpha-chains and beta(2)microglobulin and 
      expresses HLA-D molecules at decreased levels. Both parental tumor and MedB-1 cells 
      are clonally related as shown by immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement 
      analysis. Unlike the parental tumor tissue, the MedB-1 cell line cytoplasmically 
      expresses IgG/kappa in a very small subset of cells under standard culture 
      conditions. MedB-1 does not contain any Epstein-Barr virus DNA. In a tissue adhesion 
      assay MedB-1 cells showed an extensive binding to the medullary region of normal 
      thymus. Altogether, MedB-1 is a suitable tool for functional and molecular analysis 
      of this distinct lymphoma entity.

TI  - Regression of canine oral papillomas is associated with infiltration of CD4+ and 
      CD8+ lymphocytes.
PG  - 31-9
AB  - Canine oral papillomavirus (COPV) infection is used in vaccine development against 
      mucosal papillomaviruses. The predictable, spontaneous regression of the papillomas 
      makes this an attractive system for analysis of cellular immunity. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis of the timing and phenotype of immune cell infiltration 
      revealed a marked influx of leukocytes during wart regression, including abundant 
      CD4+ and CD8+ cells, with CD4+ cells being most numerous. Comparison of these 
      findings, and those of immunohistochemistry using TCRalphabeta-, TCRgammadelta-, 
      CD1a-, CD1c-, CD11a-, CD11b-, CD11c-, CD18-, CD21-, and CD49d-specific monoclonal 
      antibodies, with previously published work in the human, ox, and rabbit models 
      revealed important differences between these systems. Unlike bovine papillomavirus 
      lesions, those of COPV do not have a significant gamma/delta T-cell infiltrate. 
      Furthermore, COPV lesions had numerous CD4+ cells, unlike cottontail rabbit 
      papillomavirus lesions. The lymphocyte infiltrate in the dog resembled that in human 
      papillomavirus lesions, indicating that COPV is an appropriate model for human 
      papillomavirus immunity.

TI  - HIV-associated multinucleated giant cells in lymphoid tissue of the Waldeyer's ring: 
      a detailed study.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - Hyperplastic lymphoid tissues of the Waldeyer's ring in human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV)-infected patients may occasionally contain multinucleated giant cells (MGCs). 
      These cells, which are unrelated to any opportunistic infection, previously have 
      been demonstrated to harbor significant amounts of HIV. Studies undertaken to 
      characterize these MGCs have generated conflicting results: some reports suggested a 
      macrophage origin, whereas others supported a dendritic cell lineage. This study was 
      performed to determine the occurrence of MGCs in a series of adenoid/tonsil 
      specimens from HIV-seropositive patients showing no histological evidence of 
      opportunistic infection in order to further characterize the phenotype of these 
      cells and to investigate the role of a viral infection in their pathogenesis. 
      Adenoid/tonsil tissue specimens from 21 HIV-seropositive patients with no documented 
      opportunistic infection were scrutinized for the presence of MGCs and evaluated 
      immunohistochemically on paraffin sections by antibodies directed against various 
      macrophage and DC antigens. These antigens included CD68, the macrophage marker 3A5, 
      major histocompatibility complex Class II, S-100 protein, CD1a, and CD83. Additional 
      immunostainings directed at CD21 and CD35 as well as at the HIV-associated p24 
      antigen were also performed. Finally, the presence of Epstein-Barr virus and human 
      herpesvirus 8 viral sequences was investigated by in situ hybridization and by 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis, respectively. MGCs were found in 14 patients 
      (66.7%), regardless of gender, age, method of viral transmission, CD4 cell count, 
      viral load, or ethnic group. These cells were mostly localized at the 
      lymphoepithelium layer of the tonsillar crypts and, to a lesser extent, in the 
      interfollicular areas of the underlying lymphoid tissue, which consistently 
      exhibited features of follicular hyperplasia. Phenotypically, MGCs were found to be 
      CD68+, 3A5+, major histocompatibility complex Class II+, S-100 protein+/-, CD1a-, 
      CD21-, CD35-, and CD83-. Although the HIV-associated p24 protein was consistently 
      present in the cytoplasm of these cells, no sign of Epstein-Barr virus or human 
      herpesvirus 8 infection could be demonstrated. Consequently, our study didn't show 
      any conclusive evidence to support that MGCs in hyperplastic lymphoid tissues of the 
      Waldeyer's ring from HIV-seropositive patients originated from dendritic cells. The 
      definite nature of these cells has yet to be elucidated, but it is plausible that 
      they simply represent activated macrophages that are infected with HIV present in 
      the oropharyngeal secretions during the circulation of their precursor through the 
      lymphoepithelium area of adenoids and tonsils.

      responding to Gal alpha 1,3Gal epitopes in alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient 
      mice.
PG  - 5518-29
AB  - Human natural Abs against Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc (Gal) epitopes are a major 
      barrier to xenotransplantation. Studies in this report, which use combined 
      multiparameter flow cytometric sorting and enzyme-linked immunospot assay, 
      demonstrate that anti-Gal IgM-producing cells are found exclusively in a small B 
      cell subpopulation (i.e., CD21(-/low) IgM(high) B220(low) CD5(-) Mac-1(-) 493(-) 
      cells) in the spleens of alpha1, 3-galactosyltransferase-deficient mice. All 
      IgM-producing cells were detected in a similar splenic subpopulation of alpha1, 
      3-galactosyltransferase-deficient and wild-type mice. A higher frequency of B cells 
      with anti-Gal surface IgM receptors was observed in the peritoneal cavity than in 
      the spleen, but these did not actively secrete Abs, and showed phenotypic properties 
      of B-1b cells (CD21(-/low) IgM(high) CD5(-) CD43(+) Mac-1(+)). However, these became 
      Mac-1(-) and developed anti-Gal Ab-producing activity after in vitro culture with 
      LPS. The splenic B cells with anti-Gal receptors consisted of both Mac-1(+) B-1b 
      cells and Mac-1(-) B-1b-like cells. The latter comprised most anti-Gal IgM-producing 
      cells. Our studies indicate that anti-Gal natural IgM Abs are produced by a 
      B1b-like, Mac-1(-) splenic B cell population and not by plasma cells or B-1a cells. 
      They are consistent with a model whereby B-1b cells lose Mac-1 expression upon Ag 
      exposure and that these, rather than plasma cells, become the major IgM Ab-producing 
      cell population.

TI  - CD21-mediated entry and stable infection by Epstein-Barr virus in canine and rat 
      cells.
PG  - 10745-51
AB  - We developed an adenovirus vector for transduction of the human CD21 gene 
      (Adv-CD21), the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific receptor on human B lymphocytes, 
      to overcome the initial barrier of EBV infection in nonprimate mammalian cells. 
      Inoculation of Adv-CD21 followed by exposure to recombinant EBV carrying a 
      selectable marker resulted in the successful entry of EBV into three of seven 
      nonprimate mammalian cell lines as evidenced by expression of EBV-determined nuclear 
      antigen (EBNA). The EBV-susceptible cell lines included rat glioma-derived 9L, rat 
      mammary carcinoma-derived c-SST-2, and canine kidney-derived MDCK. Subsequent 
      selection culture with G418 yielded drug-resistant cell clones. In these cell 
      clones, EBV existed as an episomal form, as evidenced through the Gardella gel 
      technique. Among the known EBV latency-associated gene products, EBV-encoded small 
      RNAs, EBNA1 and transcripts from the BamHI-A rightward reading frame (BARF0), and 
      latent membrane protein 2A were expressed in all EBV-infected cell clones. The viral 
      lytic events could be induced in these cell clones by simultaneous treatment with 
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and n-butyric acid, but they were abortive, and 
      infectious virus was not produced. These results indicate that once the initial 
      barrier for attachment is overcome artificially, EBV can establish a stable 
      infection in some nonprimate mammalian cells, and they raise the possibility that 
      transgenic animals with the human CD21 gene could provide an animal model for EBV 
      infection.

TI  - Infectious Epstein-Barr virus lacking major glycoprotein BLLF1 (gp350/220) 
      demonstrates the existence of additional viral ligands.
PG  - 10142-52
AB  - The binding of the viral major glycoprotein BLLF1 (gp350/220) to the CD21 cellular 
      receptor is thought to play an essential role during infection of B lymphocytes by 
      the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, since CD21-negative cells have been reported 
      to be infectible with EBV, additional interactions between viral and cellular 
      molecules seem to be probable. Based on a recombinant genomic EBV plasmid, we 
      deleted the gene that encodes the viral glycoprotein BLLF1. We tested the ability of 
      the viral mutant to infect different lymphoid and epithelial cell lines. Primary 
      human B cells, lymphoid cell lines, and nearly all of the epithelial cell lines that 
      are susceptible to wild-type EBV infection could also be successfully infected with 
      the viral mutant in vitro, although the efficiency of infection with BLLF1-negative 
      virus was clearly lower than the one observed with wild-type EBV. Our studies show 
      that the interaction between BLLF1 and CD21 is not absolutely required for the 
      infection of lymphocytes and epithelial cells, indicating that viral molecules other 
      than BLLF1 can mediate the binding of EBV to its target cells. In this context, our 
      results further suggest the hypothesis that additional cellular molecules, apart 
      from CD21, allow virus entry into these cells.

      blood. B cells isolated from lymph node and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs) of 4 and 23 chronically infected patients, respectively, demonstrated 
      similar capacities to pass virus to activated HIV-negative PBMCs when compared with 
      CD4(+) cells from the same patients. However, in contrast to T cells, virus 
      associated with B cells was surface bound, as shown by its sensitivity to pronase 
      and the staining pattern revealed by in situ amplification of HIV-1 RNA. Cell 
      sorting and ligand displacing approaches established that CD21 was the HIV-binding 
      receptor on B cells, and that this association was mediated through 
      complement-opsonized virus. These B cells were also found to express significantly 
      lower levels of CD21 compared with HIV-negative individuals, suggesting a direct 
      perturbing effect of HIV on B cells. These findings suggest that B cells, although 
      they themselves are not readily infected by HIV, are similar to follicular dendritic 
      cells in their capacity to serve as extracellular reservoirs for HIV-1. Furthermore, 
      B cells possess the added capability of circulating in peripheral blood and 
      migrating through tissues where they can potentially interact with and pass virus to 
      T cells.

TI  - Proliferation of CD4+ lymphocytes in a patient with chronic graft-versus-host 
      disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
PG  - 389-93
AB  - Expansion of donor-derived lymphocytes after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is 
      a serious and sometimes fatal complication. Lymphoproliferative disorders are 
      reportedly caused mainly by reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and 
      non-EBV-associated secondary lymphoma or leukemia. In this paper, we report massive 
      proliferation of CD4+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood of a patient with chronic 
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation 
      (alloBMT) from an HLA-identical sibling donor. The abnormal lymphocytes showed 
      CD3low, CD4+, CD8-, CD2+, CD5+, CD7+, CD25-, CD19-, CD20-, CD21-, CD16-, CD56low, 
      T-cell receptor (TCR)-alpha/beta- and TCR-gamma/delta- phenotypes, and no 
      rearrangement of either TCR-C beta 1 or IG(H)JH was detected from the lymphocytes by 
      Southern blot analysis. EBV was not found in the nuclei of lymphocytes by an 
      immunofluorescence antibody. The lymphoproliferation was resistant against 
      immunosuppressive drugs, administered for the treatment of chronic GVHD, and it 
      effectively inhibited aggravation of the chronic GVHD. Although antithymocyte 
      globulin and cytosine arabinoside were administered later, the patient died of 
      respiratory failure with bilateral pleural effusion and interstitial pneumonia. 
      Because we found no evidence of monoclonality of the abnormal lymphocytes, we could 
      not conclude that this patient had suffered from malignant lymphoproliferation. To 
      our knowledge, this is the first case report of proliferation of CD4+ lymphocytes in 
      a patient with chronic GVHD following alloBMT. In this paper, we discuss the 
      possible pathophysiology of the patient.

TI  - Effect of interleukin-7 on the in vitro development and maturation of monocyte 
      derived human dendritic cells.
PG  - 361-71
AB  - We have compared the cell phenotype and functional properties of monocyte/macrophage 
      derived dendritic cells (DCs) obtained by culture of human adherent peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in medium containing granulocyte macrophage colony 
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF) either alone (GM-CSF-DCs), or in combination with 
      interleukin (IL)-4 (IL4-DCs) or IL-7 (IL7-DCs). The cell surface phenotype of 
      GM-CSF-DCs and IL-7-DCs was characterized by a high expression of major 
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II, CD80, CD86 and CD40. In contrast to 
      'classical' IL-4-DCs, these two types of DCs expressed CD14 and a CD21-like molecule 
      detected by two out of four CD21-specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) tested. The 
      same pattern of reactivity with CD21 specific antibodies was observed in freshly 
      isolated adherent PBMCs but not in B lymphocytes. This reactivity was upregulated by 
      IL-7 in a dose dependent manner. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment induced the 
      upregulation of CD40, CD80, CD86 and the T-cell stimulatory capacity in IL-4-DCs 
      and, to a lesser extent, in the IL-7-DCs whereas GM-CSF-DCs responded very poorly to 
      such treatment. Our data indicate that, together with GM-CSF, the IL-7 drives 
      macrophage precursors to a differentiation stage that is close to but distinct from 
      the phenotype of IL-4-DCs. Comparison of DC development in the presence of IL-7 or 
      IL-4 may help in dissecting signalling pathways that regulate the expression of 
      functionally relevant DC markers.

TI  - B lymphocyte pathology in human colorectal cancer. Experimental and clinical 
      therapeutic effects of partial B cell depletion.
PG  - 541-9
AB  - Accumulating data are showing that the humoral immune response against tumors could 
      favor tumor progression. However, no B lymphocyte pathology has been reported in 
      cancer. Using anti-IgM Ab we nonspecifically depleted B cells in tumor-bearing mice, 
      a treatment that resulted in significant reduction of tumor burden. We analyzed the 
      B lymphocyte phenotype of abdominal lymph nodes and peripheral blood from advanced 
      colon cancer patients by flow cytometry, and compared the B cell phenotype with that 
      found in samples from normal donors. In both lymph nodes and peripheral blood of 
      cancer patients, abnormal populations of B lymphocytes appeared that express an 
      increased CD21 and/or sTn antigens on their cell surface. All patients showed a 
      reduction of CD19+ cells. In a limited clinical test, we analyzed the effects of a 
      partial B cell depletion with Rituximab. The treated patients did not develop any 
      side-effects; the CD21-hyperpositive lymphocytes were reduced, but the proportion of 
      sTn-positive lymphocytes remained unaffected. Apparent reduction of the tumor burden 
      was reported in 50% of the patients when the treatment was ended.

TI  - HIV-associated Waldeyer's ring lymphoid hyperplasias: characterization of 
      multinucleated giant cells and the role of Epstein-Barr virus.
PG  - 1383-8
AB  - Lymphoid hyperplasia of Waldeyer's ring (WR) is an often-symptomatic complication of 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A characteristic but not well 
      explained finding is the presence of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) adjacent to 
      crypt or surface epithelium. To further elucidate the MNGCs and assess their 
      relationship to HIV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 12 specimens from 11 HIV-positive 
      patients were stained with antibodies to HIV-1 p24, EBV (latent membrane protein, 
      LMP-1), histiocytes (CD68), and other antigen-presenting cells: S-100 protein, the 
      Langerhans cell (LC) marker CD1a, and the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) marker 
      (CD21). Double immunofluorescent staining to assess co-expression of p24 and 
      cell-specific markers was performed and analyzed by laser-scanning confocal 
      microscopy with 3-dimensional reconstruction. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded 
      small RNA (EBER) was performed in all cases. Immunostains showed MNGCs labeled for 
      p24, S-100, and CD68, but not CD1a. In 1 case, rare MNGCs were CD21-positive. EBV 
      LMP-1 was uniformly negative, although EBER-positive lymphocytes were seen by in 
      situ hybridization in 9 of 12 specimens (numerous in only 3 specimens). Double 
      immunofluorescent staining showed co-localization of p24 with CD68 and S-100. Our 
      results suggest that MNGCs are generally HIV-infected, EBV-negative, and most likely 
      represent an unusual S-100-positive histiocyte subset (not LC or FDC). Their exact 
      pathophysiologic role remains uncertain. EBV does not appear to play a major role in 
      the pathogenesis of WR lymphoid hyperplasias in HIV infection.

TI  - Benign vascular neoplasms of the spleen with myoid and angioendotheliomatous 
      features.
PG  - 328-36
AB  - AIMS: To present the clinical light microscopic and immunophenotypic features of a 
      distinctive vascular neoplasm of the spleen. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two of the splenic 
      lesions arose in children, and one was found in an adult. They ranged from 19 to 40 
      mm diameter and histologically were quite similar. Sheets of large epithelioid cells 
      with a spectrum of nuclear configurations ranging from oval and vesicular to twisted 
      and hyperchromatic were noted in each case. Distinct or prominent nucleoli were 
      present in many cells, and occasional cells had nuclear pseudoinclusions. In two 
      cases, bands of basophilic, fibroblast-rich stroma with scattered chronic 
      inflammatory cells were present. The mitotic rate ranged from 0/10 high-power fields 
      (HPF) to 0.5/10 HPF in these epithelioid cells. The vascular nature of these tumours 
      was manifested as a sieve-like array of round, erythrocyte-filled spaces, most with 
      attenuated and cytologically bland lining cells. The polygonal, epithelioid cells 
      exhibited the following phenotype: smooth muscle actin (SMA)+, muscle specific actin 
      (MSA)+, vimentin+, CD31-, CD34-, CD21-, CD8-, CD68- (2/3 cases), S100-, while the 
      lining cells were CD34+, vimentin+ and SMA-, with variable CD31 and factor VIII 
      related antigen expression. Elongated SMA+, MSA+ cell processes were evident in one 
      case, reminiscent of previously characterized myoid elements of the normal spleen. 
      An uneventful follow-up was noted for all three patients. CONCLUSIONS: The histology 
      and immunophenotype set these neoplasms apart from classic hamartomas, haemangiomas 
      and previously characterized (haem)angioendotheliomas of the spleen, and may 
      represent proliferations of myoid elements native to the spleen.

TI  - CD21-Dependent infection of an epithelial cell line, 293, by Epstein-Barr virus.
PG  - 2115-25
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is invariably present in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal 
      carcinomas, is found sporadically in other carcinomas, and replicates in the 
      differentiated layer of the tongue epithelium in lesions of oral hairy leukoplakia. 
      However, it is not clear how frequently or by what mechanism EBV infects epithelial 
      cells normally. Here, we report that a human epithelial cell line, 293, can be 
      stably infected by EBV that has been genetically marked with a selectable gene. We 
      show that 293 cells express a relatively low level of CD21, that binding of 
      fluorescein-labeled EBV to 293 cells can be detected, and that both the binding of 
      virus to cells and infection can be blocked with antibodies specific for CD21. Two 
      proteins known to form complexes with CD21 on the surface of lymphoid cells, CD35 
      and CD19, could not be detected at the surface of 293 cells. All infected clones of 
      293 cells exhibited tight latency with a pattern of gene expression similar to that 
      of type II latency, but productive EBV replication and release of infectious virus 
      could be induced inefficiently by forced expression of the lytic transactivators, R 
      and Z. Low levels of mRNA specific for the transforming membrane protein of EBV, 
      LMP-1, as well as for LMP-2, were detected; however, LMP-1 protein was either 
      undetectable or near the limit of detection at less than 5% of the level typical of 
      EBV-transformed B cells. A slight increase in expression of the receptor for 
      epidermal growth factor, which can be induced in epithelial cells by LMP-1, was 
      detected at the cell surface with two EBV-infected 293 cell clones. These results 
      show that low levels of surface CD21 can support infection of an epithelial cell 
      line by EBV. The results also raise the possibility that in a normal infection of 
      epithelial cells by EBV, the LMP-1 protein is not expressed at levels that are high 
      enough to be oncogenic and that there might be differences in the cells of 
      EBV-associated epithelial cancers that have arisen to allow for elevated expression 
      of LMP-1.

TI  - Role of complement receptors CD21/CD35 in B lymphocyte activation and survival.
PG  - 63-8; discussion 69
AB  - In summary, the complement system has evolved an important function in regulation of 
      humoral immunity to T-dependent antigens. Covalent attachment of activated C3 to 
      antigen alters its fate by enhancing uptake on the surface of FDC via CD21/CD35; and 
      by enhancing signal transduction via the B cell coreceptor CD21/CD19/Tapa-1. In the 
      absence of complement receptors CD21/CD35 or C3 ligand, naive B cells bearing low 
      affinity BCR fail to effectively survive within the lymphoid follicle following 
      contact with antigen and death is mediated by a Fas-dependent mechanism. 
      Alternatively, B cells sufficiently activated to initiate a GC reaction fail to 
      survive in the absence of CD21-CD21L interaction.

TI  - Complement opsonization is required for presentation of immune complexes by resting 
      peripheral blood B cells.
PG  - 6537-43
AB  - Complement receptor 2 (CD21, CR2) is a B cell receptor for complement degradation 
      products bound to Ag or immune complexes. The role of CD21 in mediating Ag 
      presentation of soluble immune complexes by resting B cells was studied. 
      Complement-coated immune complexes were formed by the incubation of influenza virus 
      with serum from immune donors. These complexes bound to peripheral blood B cells in 
      a complement-dependent manner. The binding required CD21 or, to a lesser extent, 
      complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35). B cells pulsed with immune complexes containing 
      complement elicited a response from a panel of influenza-specific T cell clones, 
      while those pulsed with immune complexes formed in the absence of complement did 
      not. The expression of the early activation marker CD69 and the costimulatory 
      molecule CD86 were not induced by CD21 ligation alone, suggesting that CD21-mediated 
      Ag presentation occurs independently of B cell activation. Up-regulation of these 
      markers required exposure to T cell factors elicited by the recognition of Ag 
      derived from complement-containing immune complexes. These findings suggest that 
      binding of Ag to CD21 enables Ag-nonspecific B cells to participate in the 
      activation of Ag-specific T cells in a process that occurs independently of 
      well-characterized B cell activation events.

TI  - CD19 is linked to the integrin-associated tetraspans CD9, CD81, and CD82.
PG  - 30537-43
AB  - The CD19-CD21-CD81 complex regulates signal transduction events critical for B 
      lymphocyte development and humoral immunity. CD81, a molecule with 4 transmembrane 
      domains, member of the tetraspan superfamily, is engaged, together with other 
      tetraspans such as CD9, CD53, CD63, and CD82, in multimolecular complexes containing 
      beta1 integrins and major histocompatibility complex antigens. Here we demonstrate 
      that two other tetraspans, CD82 and the early B cell marker CD9, are 
      coimmunoprecipitated with CD19 from Brij97 lysates of B cell lines. Moreover, CD9 
      was coprecipitated from lysates of purified CD10(+) early B cells. These 
      associations were confirmed by the cocapping of CD19 with CD9 or CD82. The CD9/CD19 
      association was disrupted in the presence of digitonin, contrary to the CD81/CD19 
      association, indicating that CD9 and CD81 interact with CD19 in different ways. The 
      CD9/CD81 association is also disrupted in the presence of digitonin, suggesting that 
      CD9 associates with CD19 only through CD81. To characterize the regions involved in 
      the CD81/CD19 association, two reciprocal CD9/CD81 chimeric molecules were tested 
      for the association with CD19, but none of them could be coprecipitated with CD19 in 
      digitonin, indicating that the domain of CD81 responsible for its association with 
      CD19 is complex. Finally, engagement of CD9 could induce the tyrosine 
      phosphorylation of different proteins, including CD19 itself, suggesting that the 
      CD9/CD19 association is functionally relevant. Thus, a physical and functional link 
      is formed between the CD19-CD21-CD81 complex and the integrin-tetraspan complexes, 
      which is dynamically modulated in the process of B cell differentiation.

TI  - Functional analysis of peripheral blood B cells in patients with X-linked 
      agammaglobulinemia.
PG  - 3925-9
AB  - X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary immunodeficiency disease caused by 
      mutations of Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk); Btk plays an essential role in the 
      development of mature B cells. However, small numbers of B cells ("leaky B cells") 
      are present in the peripheral blood of most XLA patients. In this study, we analyzed 
      the function of these leaky B cells obtained from XLA patients. Enough numbers of B 
      cells were available for analysis from five of nine XLA patients originally 
      screened. Sequence analysis revealed missense mutations of Btk in four of the five 
      XLA patients. No mutation was found in the coding region of Btk in one patient. 
      Western blotting and/or flow cytometric analysis failed to detect Btk protein in all 
      five patients. B cells isolated from peripheral blood of these XLA patients were 
      CD5-, CD20+, CD19+, and CD21-. If stimulated with anti-CD40 and IL-4, XLA B cells 
      proliferated normally and produced significant amounts of IgE. Anti-CD40 stimulation 
      of XLA B cells resulted in normal expression of CD23. In addition, three of the five 
      XLA patients studied were immunized with bacteriophage phiX174 and produced low but 
      detectable levels of antiphage-specific Ab. Similarly, X-linked immunodeficiency 
      mice, which carry a missense mutation in Btk, produced substantial amounts of 
      antiphage Ab. These results indicate that CD40 signaling is intact in B cells 
      lacking demonstrable Btk, and that leaky B cells in XLA patients can proliferate, 
      undergo isotype switching, and differentiate into specific Ab-producing cells.

TI  - CD81 (TAPA-1): a molecule involved in signal transduction and cell adhesion in the 
      immune system.
PG  - 89-109
AB  - CD81 (TAPA-1) is a widely expressed cell-surface protein involved in an astonishing 
      variety of biologic responses. It has been cloned independently several times for 
      different functional effects and is reported to influence adhesion, morphology, 
      activation, proliferation, and differentiation of B, T, and other cells. On B cells 
      CD81 is part of a complex with CD21, CD19, and Leu13. This complex reduces the 
      threshold for B cell activation via the B cell receptor by bridging Ag specific 
      recognition and CD21-mediated complement recognition. Similarly on T cells CD81 
      associates with CD4 and CD8 and provides a costimulatory signal with CD3. In fetal 
      thymic organ culture, mAb to CD81 block maturation of CD4-CD8- thymocytes, and 
      expression of CD81 on CHO cells endows those cells with the ability to support T 
      cell maturation. However, CD81-deficient mice express normal numbers and subsets of 
      T cells. These mice do exhibit diminished antibody responses to protein antigens. 
      CD81 is also physically and functionally associated with several integrins. 
      Anti-CD81 can activate integrin alpha 4 beta 1 (VLA-4) on B cells, facilitating 
      their adhesion to tonsilar interfollicular stroma. Similarly, anti-CD81 can activate 
      alpha L beta 2 (LFA-1) on human thymocytes. CD81 can also affect cognate B-T cell 
      interactions because anti-CD81 increases IL-4 synthesis by T cells responding to 
      antigen presented by B cells but not by monocytes. The tetraspanin superfamily (or 
      TM4SF) includes CD81, CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, CD82, CD151, and an increasing number 
      of additional proteins. Like CD81, several tetraspanins are involved in cell 
      adhesion, motility, and metastasis, as well as cell activation and signal 
      transduction.

      B-cell lineage. The transformed cell had an immature phenotype (CD79a+, CD79b-, 
      CD21-, immunoglobulin heavy and light chain negative), confirmed by antigen receptor 
      gene analysis, which showed germ line configuration. Single-copy, clonally 
      integrated FIV provirus was detected in tumor genomic DNA. FIV p24 antigen was not 
      detected in tumor cells by immunostaining. This study provides the first evidence 
      that the feline lentivirus may play a direct role in cell transformation under 
      certain circumstances.

TI  - Identification of two distinct populations of dendritic cells in afferent lymph that 
      vary in their ability to stimulate T cells.
PG  - 5372-82
AB  - Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis of dendritic cells from 
      cattle afferent lymph has established that within the afferent lymph veiled cells 
      (ALVC) there are two phenotypically distinct, major populations. One is CD11a+, 
      CD5+, CD21- and expresses the bovine WC10 (workshop cluster 10) molecule and the Ag 
      recognized by mAb CC81 but is not recognized by mAbs CC149 and IL-A24. The second 
      ALVC subpopulation is CD11a-, CD5-, CD21+/-, workshop cluster 10- and is not 
      recognized by mAb CC81 but is recognized by mAb CC149. Thus, the two populations, 
      which can be identified by staining for CD11a, are defined by the differential 
      expression of a number of Ag. The ALVC populations had differing capacities to 
      stimulate T cells. CD11a- ALVC were more effective at stimulating proliferative 
      responses in allogeneic CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. This was not related to 
      binding of CTLA4Ig or CD40L fusion proteins, implying similar levels of expression 
      of their ligands, CD80 and CD86 or CD40. Both subsets were able to present OVA to 
      resting memory CD4+ T cells, indicating that both were able to take up and process 
      soluble native protein. In contrast, the CD11a- ALVC were more effective in 
      presenting respiratory syncytial virus Ag to resting CD4+ T cells. Considering the 
      central role of dendritic cells in the initiation of immune responses in naive 
      animals, the two cell types may have different roles in the induction of primary 
      responses induced following infection or immunization.

TI  - Splenic vascular tumors: a histologic, immunophenotypic, and virologic study.
PG  - 827-35
AB  - Vascular tumors of the spleen include several different entities, some of which are 
      unique to that organ. Twenty-two such proliferations were studied, including 10 
      hemangiomas, six littoral cell angiomas, four angiosarcomas, and two hamartomas. The 
      hemangiomas included seven with localized tumors and three with diffuse angiomatosis 
      of the spleen. All cases were studied by paraffin section immunohistochemistry with 
      a large panel of antibodies. In addition, all cases were studied for the presence of 
      the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) using the polymerase chain 
      reaction. The morphologic findings were similar to those previously reported. All 
      proliferations were vimentin positive, and one angiosarcoma was focally keratin 
      positive. All cases reacted for CD31, whereas 20 of 22 were positive for von 
      Willebrand's factor and 19 of 22 were positive for Ulex europeaus. CD34 expression 
      in lining cells was identified in 10 of 10 hemangiomas, two of four angiosarcomas, 
      and one of two hamartomas, whereas all six cases of littoral cell angioma were 
      negative. CD68 was expressed in all cases of littoral cell angioma but was also 
      positive in all three diffuse hemangiomas, two of seven localized hemangiomas, and 
      two of four angiosarcomas. CD21 expression was restricted to the lining cells of 
      littoral cell angioma, and CD8 expression was only identified in two of two 
      hamartomas and two of four angiosarcomas. KSHV was not detected in any of the cases. 
      These findings suggest that there are distinct immunophenotypic as well as 
      morphologic features of splenic vascular tumors. Littoral cell angiomas have a 
      characteristic CD34-/CD68+/CD21+/CD8- immunophenotype and hamartomas have a 
      characteristic CD68-/CD21-/CD8+ phenotype. The frequent CD68 expression in diffuse 
      hemangioma suggests an immunophenotypic difference from localized hemangioma of the 
      spleen.

TI  - CD86 (B7-2) on human B cells. A functional role in proliferation and selective 
      differentiation into IgE- and IgG4-producing cells.
PG  - 15613-9
AB  - Immunoglobulin (Ig) E production by B cells requires two primary signals provided by 
      T cells, interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13 and CD40 ligand (CD40L). In addition, 
      costimulatory signals, such as CD23-CD21 interaction, contribute further ensuring a 
      selective control over this production. Recently, CD28, expressed on T cells, has 
      been reported to be involved in this process. The CD28 ligands, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 
      (B7-2), are expressed on human tonsillar B cells, and their expression is 
      up-regulated by IL-4, IL-13, and/or an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb). We have 
      investigated whether signaling via the B7 molecules affects IgE synthesis. Human B 
      cells were stimulated by IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb in the presence of different 
      anti-B7 mAbs. Cross-linking of CD86 with IT2.2 potentiated IgE and IgG4 production 
      and epsilon transcripts expression. The production of the other isotypes was not 
      modulated. Conversely, the anti-CD80 and the other anti-CD86 mAbs tested had no 
      effect. The increase of IgE and IgG4 production induced by IT2.2 was accompanied by 
      an increase in proliferation, in cell surface density of CD23, and in CD23 binding 
      to CD21-expressing B cells. In contrast, the expression of other B cell surface 
      molecules such as CD11a, CD30, and CD58 remained unaffected. Since IT2.2 favors 
      CD23-CD21 pairing, we tested whether blocking this interaction affected 
      IT2.2-increased IgE production. The neutralizing anti-CD23 mAb, Mab 25, caused a 
      dose-dependent inhibition of the effect of IT2.2 on IgE synthesis. Finally, IT2.2 
      potentiation on B cell proliferation and IgE production required the two primary 
      signals, IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb, since IT2.2 alone or in combination with only one 
      of these stimuli did not show any effect on B cells. This study is the first 
      demonstration of a signaling role for CD86. Together with IL-4 or IL-13 and CD40L, 
      CD86 favors CD23-CD21 pairing and consequently functions as a selective and potent 
      costimulus for human IgE and IgG4 synthesis.

TI  - A nodal gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma with an association of Epstein-Barr virus.
PG  - 729-36
AB  - The postthymic gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma is rare, and most occur as extranodal 
      tumors, e.g., in hepatosplenic or cutaneous forms. We here report an unusual nodal 
      case that initially presented as a T-zone lymphoma. The neoplasm recurred as 
      systemic lymphadenopathy 25 months after complete remission with terminal high-grade 
      transformation. Phenotypic analysis showed CD1-, CD2+, CD3+, CD4-, CD5-, CD7+, CD8+, 
      CD10-, CD16-, CD19-, CD20-, CD21-, CD25-, CD56-, CD57-, T-cell receptor (TCR) 
      alpha/beta antigens negative, TCR gamma/delta antigens positive, and an HLA-DR+ 
      phenotype. Cytogenetic studies showed clonal chromosomal translocations involving 
      chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 8, 15, and X in eight of 15 cells; t(X;5;1)(q13;q13;p22) and 
      t(6;15;8)(p22;q26;q13). Genotypic analysis showed the same clone, characterized by 
      the TCR gamma-chain gene rearrangement pattern, to be present in both initial and 
      recurrent tumors. The lymphoma cells were also demonstrated to express the latent 
      membrane protein-1 by immunohistochemistry and EBV-encoded small RNAs by in situ 
      hybridization. Southern blot analysis using the probe of the terminal repeat 
      demonstrated incorporation of multiple copies of EBV in the recurrent tumor. 
      However, the initial lesion, which contained a smaller number of EBV-positive cells, 
      showed no such evidence of clonal proliferation. These data suggest that EBV may be 
      associated with high-grade transformation, although its exact role in 
      lymphomagenesis remains uncertain. The present study also adds to our understanding 
      of the clinicopathologic spectrum of gamma/delta T-cell neoplasia.

TI  - Increase in CD23+ B cells in infants with bronchiolitis is accompanied by appearance 
      of IgE and IgG4 antibodies specific for respiratory syncytial virus.
PG  - 32-7
AB  - Infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may induce asthma-like symptoms and 
      RSV-specific IgE in infected infants as a result of Th2-like response to RSV. The 
      effect of RSV infection on the expression of B cell antigens CD21 and CD23, putative 
      participants in Th2 responses, was investigated. Samples from bronchiolitic infants 
      (n = 19) were tested by three-color immunofluorescence flow cytometry during the 
      acute phase of infection and 4-6 weeks later. In 6 of 10 RSV-positive infants, the 
      percentage of CD23+ B cells was higher than in 9 RSV-negative children and in 
      controls. Both CD21+ and CD21- B cells exhibited a higher percentage of CD23. The 
      group with increased expression of CD23 antigen had RSV-specific IgE and IgG4 
      antibodies. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that RSV could provoke a 
      Th2-type response, but the relationship between CD23 antigen and RSV infection must 
      be determined.

TI  - Differential regulation of antigen-specific IgG4 and IgE antibodies in response to 
      recombinant filarial proteins.
PG  - 1841-8
AB  - Having identified two recombinant filarial proteins (Ov27 and OvD5B) that induced 
      patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells to produce antigen-specific IgG4/IgE 
      antibodies in vitro, we assessed the role these filarial antigens play in inducing 
      antigen-specific isotype switching (gamma 4 and epsilon) in the absence of T cells. 
      Purified CD19+ s gamma-/s epsilon- B cells were cultured with either of these 
      antigens in the presence of anti-CD40 mAb and human IL-4. Both antigen and 
      polyclonal signals delivered by IL-4 (or IL-13) were necessary for the induction of 
      specific IgG4/IgE antibodies. To assess the role played by cytokines produced by B 
      lymphocytes in antigen-driven selection of the gamma 4 or epsilon isotype, 
      neutralizing anti-cytokine antibodies were used in vitro. While anti-IL-12 
      antibodies did not alter the antigen-specific IgG4/IgE production, anti-IL-6, 
      anti-IL-13 and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibodies significantly inhibited 
      the production of IgG4/IgE. Anti-IL-2 and anti-IL-10 antibodies appeared to 
      down-regulate antigen-specific IgG4 antibodies without affecting antigen-specific 
      IgE antibodies. Although anti-CD21 antibodies had no effect on specific IgE 
      antibodies, they up-regulated specific IgG4 antibodies, a finding paralleled by 
      anti-CD23 antibodies. These data suggest that certain filarial antigen-specific 
      IgG4/IgE responses can be differentially regulated and that certain endogenously 
      produced molecules from B cells-such as IL-2, IL-10, CD23 and CD21-play a 
      significant role in the induction of specific isotypes of antigen-specific 
      antibodies.

TI  - Interactions involving cyclosporine A, interleukin-6, and Epstein-Barr virus lead to 
      the promotion of B-cell lymphoproliferative disease.
PG  - 379-90
AB  - Post-transplant patients undergoing prolonged Cyclosporine A (CsA) immunosuppressive 
      therapy were reported to have an increased incidence of Epstein-Barr virus 
      (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV-infected B cells cultured with 
      CsA demonstrated increased EBV B-cell out-growth as compared to those cultured 
      without CsA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), following infection with EBV 
      and CsA treatment, demonstrated increased IL-6 activity in the culture supernatant. 
      The induction of IL-6 appeared to differ within the various lymphocyte populations. 
      In monocytes and B cells, IL-6 expression was preferentially induced by EBV, and 
      initiated by the binding of the two major virion glycoproteins, gp350 and gp220, to 
      CD21, or a CD21-like receptor. Expression of IL-6 in T cells appeared to be due 
      mainly to CsA. B cells also expressed IL-6 following EBV exposure, but not following 
      CsA treatment. EBY-immortalized B-cell lines cultured with CsA exhibited both an 
      increased number of cells expressing viral lytic-cycle antigens and increased 
      amounts of lytic-cycle proteins. IL-6, which was induced by CsA in PBMC, was also 
      capable of inducing the lytic viral cycle in several EBV-immortalized cells. When 
      IL-6 was expressed, it was shown to act as an autocrine growth factor for B cells 
      and to inhibit the immune system allowing for the promotion of B-cell tumors by 
      impairing lymphokine-activated killer cells. Thus CsA treatment, in promoting both 
      increased numbers of lytic EBV B cells and expression of the EBV paracrine growth 
      factor, IL-6, within the microenvironment of EBV B:T cell and EBV B:monocyte 
      interactions, may lead to increased EBV B-cell immortalization and ultimately result 
      in the promotion of B-cell lymphomas in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  - Ligation of the functional domain of complement receptor type 2 (CR2, CD21) is 
      relevant for complex formation in T cell lines.
PG  - 2580-4
AB  - We investigated the potential of CD21, the complement receptor type 2, to form 
      receptor complexes with other membrane molecules on T cell lines. CD21 from T cell 
      lines transformed with human T cell leukemia virus type I (MT2, HUT-102, C5.MJ, 
      Mondi, and C91.PL) and T cell lines that were not virus transformed was analyzed by 
      coprecipitation following cell lysis with digitonin. mAbs binding to functional and 
      nonfunctional epitopes of CD21 and a polyclonal antiserum against its intracellular 
      portion precipitated CD21, which was indistinguishable from CD21 on B cell lines. In 
      contrast to B cells, where CD21 is complexed with CD19 and CD81 (target of 
      anti-proliferative Ab 1) or, alternatively, with CD35 (CR1), no surface molecules 
      could be coprecipitated with three of four mAbs from these T cell lines. Therefore, 
      we assume that CD21 is not part of a preformed complex in T cell lines. OKB7, the 
      only mAb directed against the functional C3d binding site, coprecipitated two 
      proteins of 105 and 55 Mr with CD21 from MT2 and Mondi cells and from the T cell 
      lines Jurkat E6-1 and SupT1. These bands were also recovered with CD21 precipitated 
      from MT2 cells with C3d bound to Sepharose via the internal thioester, but were 
      absent in CD21-expressing B cell lines. As C3d and OKB7 are functional ligands for B 
      cells, we propose that upon ligation on T cells, CD21 associates with molecules of 
      105/55 Mr in the plasma membrane. Whether this is the first event of a signal 
      delivered to the T cell is under current investigation.

TI  - Canine lymphoma: immunocytochemical analysis of fine-needle aspiration biopsy.
PG  - 204-12
AB  - Cytospin preparations of fine-needle aspirates from 21 dogs with peripheral 
      lymphadenopathy (18 with lymphoma and three with lymph node hyperplasia) were 
      studied by combining morphologic and immunocytochemical analysis. Fine-needle 
      aspirates were taken from at least two enlarged lymph nodes, and the diagnosis was 
      based on air-dried smears stained with May-Grünwald Giemsa. Fine-needle aspiration 
      biopsy always provided an adequate quality and quantity of cells to perform 
      morphologic and immunologic studies. Immunophenotyping was performed on cytospin 
      preparations with a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies specific for canine cell 
      surface antigens and one rabbit polyclonal antibody (A452) against human CD3, which 
      cross-reacts with dog antigen. The immunocytochemical study resulted in the 
      diagnosis of 14 B-cell lymphomas (CD21+, CD3-) and three T-cell lymphomas (all CD3+, 
      two CD8+). One lymphoma lacked surface antigens specific for the B- or T-cell 
      lineage and was classified as non-B-non-T lymphoma (CD21-, CD3-, CD4-, CD8-). The 
      monoclonal antibodies CA12.10C12, CA4.1D3, and CA1D6 and the polyclonal antibody 
      A452, used as a group, appeared to be the most useful reagents to suggest lymphoid 
      origin and to discriminate between T-and B-cell phenotype. Cytospin preparations in 
      combination with immunocytochemistry provided a practical, economical, and accurate 
      method for the diagnosis and phenotyping of canine lymphoma.

TI  - Immunohistochemical analysis of the lymphoid organs of dogs naturally infected with 
      canine distemper virus.
PG  - 185-90
AB  - The pathogenesis of acute canine distemper in three naturally infected dogs was 
      investigated. The lymphoid organs showed atrophy without secondary follicles. The 
      distribution of canine distemper virus (CDV) antigens was examined 
      immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies specific for canine Thy-1, 
      immunoglobulin (Ig) M, CD4, CD8, CD21 and CD45RB, and anti-measles virus 
      nucleocapsid protein serum. The viral antigens were located in the T-cell-dependent 
      areas and in the follicles of lymphoid organs; they were observed mainly in the 
      Thy-1, or CD4-positive cells, but also in the CD8-, CD21-, or IgM-positive cells. 
      The results indicated that Thy-1-positive and CD4-positive T cells serve as major 
      target cells for CDV during the acute stage of infection.

TI  - Effect of an asthmatic attack on CD23 and CD21 expression on lymphocytes from 
      allergic children during the allergen season.
PG  - 690-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The overproduction of IgE antibodies by atopic individuals in response 
      to inhaled aeroallergen, forms the basis of an allergic disease. Furthermore, the 
      exposure to allergen might trigger the symptom exacerbation. OBJECTIVE: In children 
      with bronchial asthma, the possible effects of seasonal, natural exposure to 
      allergen on the expression of CD21 and CD23 antigens on B lymphocytes, and on the 
      expression of HLA-DR, CD45RA and CD45RO on CD4+ T cells investigated. METHODS: 
      Heparinized blood samples were obtained from 15 children with bronchial asthma 
      allergic to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) at the time of an acute asthmatic 
      attack and 2-4 weeks after the attack when the peak expiratory flow (PEF) was 
      stabilized. The samples were analysed on a flow cytometer after the three-colour 
      immunofluorescence staining had been performed. RESULTS: The increased proportion of 
      B cells expressing CD23 antigen was found at the time of attack rather than after 
      stabilization. Serum levels of total and Der p-specific IgE increased 2-4 weeks 
      after the asthmatic attack. This increase was accompanied by a further increase in 
      the expression of CD23 antigen on CD21- B lymphocytes. In 10 out of 15 tested 
      children, we found CD23 expressed on CD4+HLA-DR+ T cells during the asthmatic 
      attack. No significant difference was found in the expression of CD45RA and CD45RO. 
      CONCLUSION: Since we have previously demonstrated the increased percentage of CD23 
      on CD21- B cells in allergic children as compared with controls, we speculate that 
      natural exposure to the allergen which caused the increase in total and specific IgE 
      levels might be related to the increased expression of CD23 on CD21- B cells.

TI  - Expression of CD21 antigen on myeloma cells and its involvement in their adhesion to 
      bone marrow stromal cells.
PG  - 3704-12
AB  - The mature myeloma cells express very late antigen 5 (VLA-5) and MPC-1 antigens on 
      their surface and adhere to bone marrow (BM) stromal cells more tightly than the 
      VLA-5-MPC-1- immature myeloma cells in vitro. The VLA-5 and MPC-1 antigens possibly 
      function as two of the molecules responsible for interaction of mature myeloma cells 
      with BM stromal cells. However, the immature myeloma cells do interact with BM 
      stromal cells, and it is unclear which adhesion molecules mediate their interaction. 
      In this study, we found that both immature and mature myeloma cells expressed CD21, 
      an adhesion molecule known to bind to CD23. CD21 was also detected on normal plasma 
      cells. To evaluate the role of CD21 expression on myeloma cells, two myeloma cell 
      lines, NOP-2 (VLA-5-MPC-1-) and KMS-5 (VLA-5+MPC-1+), were used as representatives 
      of immature and mature myeloma cell types, respectively, and an adhesion assay was 
      performed between the myeloma cell lines and BM stromal cells. Antibody-blocking 
      results showed that adhesion of the mature type KMS-5 to KM102, a human BM-derived 
      stromal cell line, or to short-term cultured BM primary stromal cells was inhibited 
      by monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against CD21, VLA-5, and MPC-1, and inhibition of 
      adhesion of the immature type NOP-2 to KM102 by the anti-CD21 MoAb was observed as 
      well. Furthermore, CD23 was detected on KM102. Treatment of KM102 with an anti-CD23 
      MoAb also inhibited adhesion of either KMS-5 or NOP-2 to KM102. Therefore, we 
      propose that CD21 expressed on myeloma cells likely functions as a molecule 
      responsible for the interaction of immature myeloma cells as well as mature myeloma 
      cells with BM stromal cells, and CD23 may be the ligand on the stromal cells for the 
      CD21-mediated adhesion.

TI  - Reduced CD21 (CR2) and CD54 (ICAM-1) expression in MT2 cells with HIV-1 or HIV-2 
      strains.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - Alterations in the expression of cell-surface receptors have been reported in 
      HIV-infected cells for CD4, CD25 (IL-2 receptor), CD2, CD3 and CD8 and CD26. In the 
      present study we provide evidence that CD21 is down-regulated in the human 
      T-lymphoblastoid cell line MT2 after infection with HIV-1 and -2 isolates. The same 
      effect was observed with ICAM-1 (CD54). CD21 expression was monitored by means of 
      fluorescence intensity, its functional ability to bind to C3d and by quantitative 
      measurement of CD21-antigen in supernatants and cell lysates using an immunoassay. 
      In addition, the decrease of CD21 and ICAM-1-specific mRNA suggests a mechanism at a 
      transcriptional level. Our data suggest that HIV might have a direct influence on 
      the receptor expression.

TI  - Discordant expression of immunoglobulin and its associated molecule mb-1/CD79a is 
      frequently found in mediastinal large B cell lymphomas.
PG  - 735-41
AB  - Mediastinal large B cell lymphomas are uncommon neoplasms that are thought to 
      originate from thymic B cells. An unusual feature of these neoplasms is that they 
      often lack surface immunoglobulin (Ig), a molecule ubiquitously expressed by most 
      mature B cells. In the present study we have analyzed 12 cases of mediastinal large 
      B cell lymphoma for the expression of the mb-1/CD79a polypeptide. This is a 
      component, together with B29/CD79b, of a heterodimer that is associated with surface 
      Ig on normal B cells. Our aim was to see whether loss of Ig in this type of lymphoma 
      is associated with loss of the accompanying CD79a molecule. We have also evaluated 
      128 B cell lymphomas of other categories to see whether any of them show discordance 
      between mb-1 and Ig expression and analyzed 30 T cell lymphomas as Ig-negative 
      controls. We found that 5 of the 7 mediastinal large B cell lymphomas with 
      interpretable staining results for both mb-1 and Ig, lack Ig but expressed CD79a 
      (mb-1). This phenotype was very rare in other categories of B cell lymphoma, being 
      found among 110 cases in only 5 cases that were all follicular lymphoma. The 
      remaining 105 B cell lymphomas displayed mb-1+/Ig+ phenotype. All 30 T cell 
      lymphomas were mb-1 negative. We conclude that discordant mb-1/Ig expression occurs 
      commonly in mediastinal large B cell lymphomas. In addition, the finding that 11 of 
      12 of these neoplasms express a phenotype (CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD21-, CD22+, 
      CD23-/+) that is very similar to that described for thymic medullary B cells 
      reinforces the idea that most mediastinal large B cell lymphomas are of thymic B 
      cell origin. The correlation between mb-1 and Ig staining patterns in B cell 
      lymphomas of other categories reveals that in the majority (90%), expression of the 
      antigen receptor complex parallels that of mature B cells. These data therefore 
      confirm that the expression of the mb-1 protein provides independent strong evidence 
      for the B lineage of lymphomas and may be used for their routine phenotypic 
      characterization.

TI  - Immortalization of plasma cells by plasmid DNA and its hybridoma.
PG  - 89-92
AB  - Human plasma cell lines producing IgG were cloned by the limiting dilution method 
      from polyclonally immortalized B-cell lines with the plasmid DNA (pSVTLbsr) 
      containing simian virus 40 (SV40)-gene from primary peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells of healthy and nonimmune volunteers. The plasma cell lines fused well with 
      conventional partner cells and became evenly IgG-producing hybridomas at high 
      efficiency, especially with the partner cell from human origin. One of the 
      difficulties in obtaining stable IgG-producing hybridoma using Epstein-Barr virus 
      (EBV) transformation followed by back fusion with partner cells, might mainly be 
      attributed to the inability to immortalize plasma cells on account of the very low 
      density of CD21 (EBV receptor) on the cell surface. The present CD21-independent 
      immortalization by plasmid DNA and by the infection with SV40 protein-coated plasmid 
      DNA will be a potentially effective method to obtain IgG-producing human monoclonal 
      antibodies.

TI  - Modulation of signaling via the B cell antigen receptor by CD21, the receptor for 
      C3dg and EBV.
PG  - 4448-57
AB  - CD21 is the receptor for C3dg and EBV. Several reports have shown that these CD21 
      ligands, and certain anti-CD21 mAb, trigger B cell activation, particularly when 
      combined with Ag receptor ligation. However, the characteristics, biologic 
      functions, and importance of this CD21-signaling pathway are unknown. We have used a 
      model we recently developed to study B cell activation induced by complex 
      particulate Ag, such as immune complexes and viruses, to begin to examine these 
      questions. In the current studies, we incubated purified small resting B cells with 
      100-nm latex beads bearing various combinations of CD21 ligands and mAbs to CD19, 
      CD35, and the Ag receptor. CD21, CD19, and CD35 have all been implicated in 
      modulating membrane IgM initiated signaling. Beads coated with mAb to the 
      C3dg/EBV-binding portion of CD21, but not mAb to other portions of the CD21 
      molecule, triggered B cell homotypic aggregation. Beads coated with the same CD21 
      ligands, although inactive alone, synergized with anti-IgM mAb in greatly increasing 
      (20- to 180-fold) mRNA levels of the c-fos nuclear proto-oncogene. Signaling via 
      CD21 was tyrosine kinase dependent. Levels of c-myc mRNA were not altered by CD21 
      ligands. Anti-CD19 and anti-CD35 mAb did not augment signaling via membrane IgM as 
      assessed by changes in c-fos mRNA levels. These findings indicate that CD21 ligands 
      binding to the C3dg/EBV-binding site of CD21 markedly augment B cell activation 
      initiated by Ag receptor ligation via a selective, c-fos-dependent signaling 
      pathway.

TI  - Primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma.
PG  - 175-84
AB  - PURPOSE: Primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma PMLCL is a recently described 
      entity which has provoked considerable interest lately. The unique immunophenotype 
      of the malignant cell, as well as conflicting reports regarding its response to 
      therapy, prompted us to review the current literature focusing on the pathological 
      and clinical aspects of this disease. DESIGN: We reviewed the current literature 
      that contained details on the clinical presentation, pathological profile and 
      clinical outcome. RESULTS: Most reports agree that PMLCL typically affects a young 
      female population and presents with symptoms related to compression of mediastinal 
      structures. Pathologically, the malignant cells may arise from a distinctive thymic 
      medullary B cell subpopulation which is characterized by the following phenotype: 
      CD19+, CD21-, CD20+, CD22+. Alterations of c-myc and lack of expression of HLA class 
      1 antigens on the tumour cell surface have been described. Response to treatment and 
      clinical outcome have varied from one series to another and is possibly explained by 
      the small number of patients in most series and by the heterogeneity of therapy. In 
      general, the outcome does not appear to be worse than that of other large cell 
      lymphomas although, given the young age of these patients, it might be expected to 
      be more favourable. CONCLUSIONS: Primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma is a 
      distinct clinico-pathological entity characterized by: (1) a predominance of young 
      adults; (2) female predominance (female/male ratio of 2:1) in contrast to the other 
      large cell lymphomas; (3) CD19+/CD21- immunophenotype; (4) absence of HLA-class 1 
      antigen expression; (5) possible involvement of c-myc; (6) frequent dissemination at 
      relapse to unusual anatomic sites in a pattern reminiscent of Burkitt's lymphoma. 
      The role of radiotherapy and the optimal treatment for this disorder are issues that 
      remain unresolved.

TI  - CD23 interacts with a new functional extracytoplasmic domain involving N-linked 
      oligosaccharides on CD21.
PG  - 5806-13
AB  - Human CD21 has been described as a receptor for the C3d,g and iC3b proteins of 
      complement, for the Epstein-Barr virus, and also for IFN-alpha. We reported recently 
      that CD23, a low affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R2), is a new functional 
      ligand for CD21. To determine the site of interaction of CD23 on CD21, we analyzed 
      the ability of purified recombinant CD23 incorporated into fluorescent liposomes to 
      bind CD21 mutants bearing various deletions of extracytoplasmic short consensus 
      repeats (SCRs). We found that the site of interaction of CD23 on CD21 is on SCRs 5 
      to 8, with contribution of SCRs 1 and 2. Tunicamycin treatment of CD21-transfected 
      K562 cells strongly inhibited the binding of CD23-liposomes, suggesting that an 
      N-linked sugar, present on SCRs 5 to 8, is involved in the CD23/CD21 interaction. By 
      mutating together or individually, the three asparagines present on SCRs 5 to 8, 
      asparagines (Asn) 370 and 295, but not Asn 492, were shown to be involved critically 
      in the binding of CD23. Furthermore, we mapped the binding sites of a panel of 
      anti-CD21 mAbs and found that at least six epitopes can be detected on CD21. The 
      mAbs that inhibit the most CD23 binding to CD21 map in SCRs 5 to 8. This study 
      indicates that SCRs 5 to 8 represent a novel functional domain on the CD21 molecule, 
      and is the first demonstration of an activity of an extracytoplasmic region of the 
      CD21 outside of SCRs 1 to 4.

TI  - CD21-CD23 ligand pair expression in children with allergic asthma.
PG  - 337-40
AB  - The CD23 antigen, a low affinity receptor for IgE, was recently shown to interact 
      with another ligand, CD21, and the pairing of these molecules is important in T 
      cell-B cell interaction and control of IgE production. Here, we analysed the 
      expression of CD21 and CD23 on CD4+ and CD20+ lymphocytes in 25 allergic children 
      and 12 age-matched non-allergic controls. Both the percentage (P < 0.01) and the 
      absolute number (P < 0.001) of CD23+ cells were increased in allergic children. 
      There was no difference of CD21+ cells. Double positive CD4+ CD23+ cells (2.5%) were 
      only detected in one patient, in others all CD23 being expressed on B cells. The 
      CD21 antigen was expressed only on B cells. Furthermore, allergic children had an 
      increased mean fluorescence intensity of both the CD21 (P < 0.001) and the CD23 (P < 
      0.001) receptor. To analyse the possible difference in B cell subsets expressing 
      CD21 and CD23 antigens, three-colour fluorescence analysis was performed. In 
      allergic children the subset of CD20+ CD21- cells expressed more CD23 than in 
      controls (P < 0.001). These results may mean an impaired expression and possibly 
      regulation of CD21-CD23 interaction in allergic conditions.

TI  - Phase I dose-escalation trial of iodine 131-labeled monoclonal antibody OKB7 in 
      patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
PG  - 2021-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Eighteen patients with recurrent or refractory CD21-positive, non-Hodgkin's 
      lymphoma (NHL) were treated in a phase IA dose-escalation therapeutic trial of 
      iodine 131 labeled to a fixed dose of OKB7. METHODS: Individual doses of 30 to 50 
      mCi of 131I on 25 mg OKB7 were administered 2 to 3 days apart to achieve four total 
      131I-OKB7 dose levels of 90, 120, 160, and 200 mCi. Pharmacology, dosimetry, 
      therapeutic effects, toxicity, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response, and 
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) were determined. Patients were evaluated by imaging 
      studies (including whole-body gamma camera or single-photon emission computed 
      tomography [SPECT] scans), flow cytometric analysis, bone marrow biopsy, and serial 
      blood sampling. RESULTS: Median plasma and whole-body half-lives (T1/2) were 16 
      hours and 14 hours, respectively. Plasma and whole-body radiation doses were 0.0081 
      Gy/mCi and 0.0022 Gy/mCi, respectively. Specific tumor visualization was noted in 
      eight of 18 patients. HAMA was detected in 12 of 16 patients. Nonhematologic 
      toxicity was limited to asymptomatic elevations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 
      in five of 15 patients. Hematologic toxicity was observed in six of 18 patients, but 
      was severe in only two patients. MTD in patients with diffuse lymphomatous bone 
      marrow involvement was determined to be 200 mCi in four divided doses of 50 mCi 
      131I/25 mg OKB7. Antitumor activity was observed in 13 of 18 patients (one partial 
      response [PR] and 12 mixed responses) and was dependent on the 131I-OKB7 dose 
      administered. In general, palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy, enlarged spleens, 
      skin lesions, and circulating OKB7-positive peripheral lymphocytes responded most 
      readily to treatment. 131I-OKB7 was safely administered to a patient in leukemic 
      phase of NHL with prompt subsequent loss of approximately 1 kg of tumor cells from 
      the peripheral blood without associated tumor lysis syndrome. CONCLUSION: Because 
      antitumor activity with tolerable toxicity was observed in the majority of this 
      group of heavily pretreated patients, phase II investigation of mAb OKB7 
      radioconjugates in the therapy of NHL is warranted.

PG  - 1351-7
AB  - Patients with hemophilia A without human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
      infection have lower CD4+ counts and CD4+/CD8+ ratios than controls. This is usually 
      interpreted as a therapy-induced immunodeficiency. Our data re-examine the effect of 
      therapy on peripheral blood mononuclear cell immunophenotypic subpopulations in all 
      congenital clotting disorders. Since late 1985 we have prospectively observed HIV-1 
      uninfected persons with all types and severity of disorder. Controls were household 
      members without clotting disorders or HIV-1 infection. Analyses of immunophenotype 
      and treatment included a longitudinal random effects model. Compared with controls, 
      age-adjusted CD4+ counts were significantly lower in treated patients (P < .0001) 
      and in patients with all types of clotting disorders who were seldom or never 
      treated (P = .0005). Significantly lower values among both treated and untreated 
      clotting disorder subjects (P < .05) were likewise found for total lymphocytes, 
      several other T-cell subsets, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. For most indexes, including 
      the CD4+ count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio, the type of clotting deficiency was not a 
      significant variable. Comparing persons who had no or minimal therapy with those 
      having the most showed increases in CD8+ (P = .0017) and CD20+ CD21- counts (P = 
      .0255), and a lower CD20+ CD21+/CD20+ ratio (P = .0106) in the latter. Controls and 
      persons with clotting disorders differ in CD4+ count. Among those with clotting 
      factor disorders, there is no difference attributable to type of clotting disorder 
      or factor therapy. Large amounts of treatment increased CD8+ and CD20+ CD21- counts, 
      but were not associated with a change in CD4+ count.

TI  - The growth transformation of human B cells involves superinduction of hsp70 and 
      hsp90.
PG  - 700-8
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a latent human herpes virus associated with a range of 
      malignant and non-malignant disorders. EBV binds to CD21 virus receptors on B 
      lymphocytes and growth transforms these cells; in susceptible (e.g., 
      immunodeficient) hosts such cells rapidly expand into fatal lymphomas. Virus binding 
      and infection trigger a cascade of cellular events which are transformation 
      prerequisite and analogous to non-oncogenic cell activation events but which differ 
      in several quantitative or qualitative respects. Unique trans-membrane Ca2+ 
      currents, Na+/H+ exchange, as well as tyrosine phosphorylation and p56lck-gene 
      induction suggest that even early on the transformation process has oncogenic 
      specificity. In this report we describe that two additional cellular gene families, 
      the stress proteins hsp70 and hsp90, are coordinately induced at mRNA and protein 
      levels and, quite different from hsp induction by thermal stress, this induction is 
      dependent on EBV-induced trans-membrane Ca2+ currents. Blockade of hsp induction 
      prevents transformation. The kinetics and induction prerequisites set this response 
      well apart from reported responses to thermal or viral stress protein induction. 
      Like p56lck-, hsp induction is purely a post-receptor binding event and not 
      dependent on expression of any viral gene. The induction kinetics, with a peak at 
      approximately 12-16 hr and subsequent decline to control levels, considerably extend 
      the chronological map of elements in the CD21-dependent branch of the transformation 
      pathway and suggest a specific role of induced hsp different from the cell 
      cycle-related functions observed in other cell systems.

TI  - Clinicopathologic study of primary mediastinal non-lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin's 
      lymphomas among the Japanese.
PG  - 44-54
AB  - We studied the morphologic, immunologic and clinical features of 14 cases of primary 
      non-lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of the mediastinum. The patients ranged in 
      age from 3 to 76 years, with a median age of 28 years. According to the Ann Arbor 
      classification, 71% of our cases were in an early stage. Three cases were in Stage 
      I, eight in Stage II, one in Stage III and two in Stage IV (one with multiple 
      hepatic lesions and another with bone marrow involvement). The patients were 
      heterogeneous in terms of the disease and were therefore histologically classified 
      into three categories: diffuse large B cell lymphoma with sclerosis (DLS; n = 8); 
      large cell anaplastic lymphoma (LC-Ana; n = 5); and low grade B cell lymphoma of 
      mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma; n = 1). DLS was the most common 
      group and was characterized as CD5-, CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD21- and CD22+. Imprint 
      smears showed azurophilic granules in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells of three of 
      four DLS cases. All of the six cases examined were negative when tested for 
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) sequences after hybridization with the EBV internal repeat 
      probe. DLS and MALT lymphoma cases were of a B-lineage lymphoma of the thymus, while 
      most of the LC-Ana cases were of a T-lineage lymphoma. Patients with 
      non-lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas had a relatively favorable prognosis 
      compared with lymphoblastic lymphoma (P < 0.01 by the generalized Wilcoxon test). 
      There was no significant difference in the survival between non-lymphoblastic 
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease (P > 0.05 by the generalized Wilcoxon 
      test).

TI  - "NK-like" T cytotoxicity against B lymphocytes in a hypogammaglobulinemic patient.
PG  - 601-12
AB  - Physiologically, cells with NK activity appear to exert a negative control on 
      immunoglobulin production. The clinical association of large granular lymphocyte 
      (LGL) proliferation with hypogammaglobulinemia suggests that these functional NK 
      cells could also be involved in pathological situations. We studied in vitro 
      lymphocyte functions in a patient presenting LGL proliferation associated with 
      hypogammaglobulinemia. The CD3+ CD8+ CD57+ CD16- phenotype lymphocytes expressed a 
      high NK type cytotoxicity towards K562 targets, suggesting that they may be 
      considered as "NK-like" T cells. We cultured the patient peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) with control subject PBMC and with PBMC from two other 
      subjects with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) of the CD20+ CD21- CD10- 
      phenotype. Patient PBMC exhibited a lytic activity on control PBMC and on the B 
      lymphocytes of one of the two B- CLL but only in the presence of PWM. This activity 
      was not exerted by the culture supernatant and required a cell-to-cell contact. We 
      suggest that the hypogammaglobulinemia observed in this patient may be related to a 
      cytotoxic effect exerted on B lymphocytes by a CD3+ CD8+ CD57+ CD16- LGL 
      proliferation.

TI  - [Hairy cell leukemia successfully treated with deoxycoformycin].
PG  - 1685-90
AB  - A 45-year-old male was hospitalized on September 2, 1989 with chief complaints of 
      general fatigue and fever. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly and massive 
      splenomegaly. Laboratory tests on admission showed Hb of 7.5g/dl, PLT 4.8 x 
      10(4)/microliters and WBC 9,610/microliters with 81% hairy cells. Bone marrow 
      aspirate demonstrated 55.1% hairy cells and moderate myelofibrosis. Cytochemically, 
      hairy cells were positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Surface 
      markers were SmIg G+ A+ kappa +, CD11b+, CD11c+, CD19+, CD20+, CD21-, CD25+, HC2+, 
      HLA-DR+. From these findings, a diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) was made. 
      After administration of deoxycoformycin (DCF) at a dose of 5.0mg/m2 1-2 times 
      monthly, splenomegaly disappeared, as did hairy cells from the peripheral blood. 
      Hematological level returned to within normal range except for the presence of 1.2% 
      hairy cells and mild myelofibrosis in bone marrow aspirates. DCF has so far been 
      effective for this patient. While DCF has been reported to be effective in the 
      treatment of HCL in the West, it has not been determined in Japanese patients with 
      HCL, who have different hematologic features from those of HCL patients in the West.

TI  - CD21 is a ligand for CD23 and regulates IgE production.
PG  - 505-7
AB  - The molecule CD23, a low-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R2), is a type II 
      transmembrane molecule expressed on many haemopoietic cell types. CD23 has 
      pleiotropic roles in the control of lymphocyte behaviour, suggesting that CD23 may 
      interact with another ligand in addition to IgE. To identify such a CD23 ligand, we 
      expressed and purified full-length recombinant CD23, incorporated it into 
      fluorescent liposomes and used these as a probe. We report here that fluorescent 
      liposomes carrying CD23 interact specifically with the cell-surface protein CD21, 
      identified as the receptor for Epstein-Barr virus and the complement receptor-2 on B 
      cells, some T cells and follicular dendritic cells. In addition, fluorescent 
      CD23-liposomes were shown to bind to hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) transfected with 
      CD21 complementary DNA. The interaction between fluorescent CD23-liposomes and B 
      cells or CD21-transfected BHK-21 cells was specifically inhibited by anti-CD21 and 
      anti-CD23 monoclonal antibodies. Western blotting analysis revealed that 
      14C-labelled liposomes carrying CD23, in contrast to anti-CD21 antibodies, reacted 
      with a subtype of CD21 molecules. Triggering of CD21 either with an anti-CD21 
      antibody or with recombinant soluble CD23 was shown to increase specifically 
      interleukin-4-induced IgE production from blood mononuclear cells. These results 
      demonstrate that the cell-surface protein CD21 is a ligand for CD23 and that the 
      pairing of these molecules may participate in the control of IgE production.

TI  - Mediastinal diffuse large cell lymphoma of B-cell type with azurophilic granules.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - A case of diffuse large cell lymphoma of B-cell type with unusual azurophilic 
      granules is reported. Lymphoma occurred primary in the upper anterior mediastinum 
      and was suggested to be of thymic origin. Histologically, lymphoma cells showed 
      diffuse proliferation and were large in size, frequently with multilobulated nuclei. 
      In imprint preparations stained by May-Giemsa, most lymphoma cells had basophilic 
      cytoplasm with azurophilic granules. Cytochemical studies showed the granules to be 
      negative for PAS, peroxidase, acid phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase. 
      Electron-dense granules and electron-lucent granules were found on ultrastructural 
      analysis. The cells were characterized as B-cell type by immunophenotypes of L26+, 
      CD20+, CD21-, CD22+, and PCA1+, the possession of surface monotypic IgA kappa 
      immunoglobulin, and a genotype of immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain gene 
      rearrangements.

TI  - Treatment of central nervous system B lymphoproliferative syndrome by local infusion 
      of a B cell-specific monoclonal antibody.
PG  - 246-9
AB  - A 9-month-old infant developed Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoproliferative 
      syndrome with mediastinal and central nervous system localizations, associated with 
      mediastinal tuberculosis, 5 months after heart transplantation. As a combination of 
      anti-B cell antibodies (CD21- and CD24-specific) and recombinant interferon alpha 
      2b, given intravenously, was not effective on the central nervous system disease, 
      the anti-CD21 antibody was infused intrathecally via an Ommaya reservoir. High local 
      concentrations of monoclonal antibodies were achieved, with no adverse effects. A 
      dramatic clinical response was obtained, with clearance of abnormal cells from the 
      cerebrospinal fluid and a clear reduction in the abnormalities on the brain images. 
      The patient is well 7 months later. This observation indicates that treatment of B 
      lymphoproliferative syndrome with central nervous system localization is feasible 
      using a nontoxic, local B cell-specific approach.

TI  - Partial characterization of a familial B lymphosarcoma with a thymic localization in 
      cattle.
PG  - 696-702
AB  - We recently described an original epidemiological form of bovine leukosis in cattle. 
      In the young female offspring of one bull, more than 3% of animals developed a 
      thymic lymphoblastic lymphosarcoma. Of these, 31 cases, together with a lymphoid 
      cell line established from one of the tumours, were phenotypically characterized. 
      Characterization was done using a large combination of well clustered monoclonal 
      antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies prepared in our laboratory by immunizing mice 
      either with bovine normal lymphocytes or with tumour thymic cells. The thymic 
      tumours and the cell line did not express any T lymphoid antigens but they did 
      express some B lymphoid markers. The phenotype of the tumour cells was CD45+/-, 
      CD44+/- TdT+, class II-DR+/-, CD19+/-, CD21-, Ig- and HBM 57+ (recognizing the mb-1 
      chains of the B-cell receptor). The cell line expressed a more mature phenotype: 
      TdT-, CD45-, CD44+, class II-DR+, CD19+, CD21+/- and sIgG+. These results allow us 
      to consider these tumours as B-cell derived. These B lymphosarcomas with a thymic 
      localization are reminiscent of a human mediastinal non-lymphoblastic lymphoma 
      reported as a primary mediastinal clear cell lymphoma. The possibility of a thymic 
      or extrathymic origin for this B lymphosarcoma is discussed.

TI  - Expression of the APO-1 antigen in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines correlates with a 
      shift towards a lymphoblastoid phenotype.
PG  - 3300-6
AB  - APO-1 is a cell surface molecule that induces apoptosis when ligated with the 
      monoclonal antibody anti-APO-1. Expression of APO-1 and response to anti-APO-1 was 
      investigated in a number of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive and -negative Burkitt 
      lymphoma (BL) cell lines, in EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines, and in 
      cells from fresh BL biopsies. APO-1 was not expressed in EBV-negative cell lines and 
      in EBV-positive BL cell lines with a phenotype corresponding to BL tumor biopsy 
      cells (CD10+, CD21-, CD23-, CD30-, CD39-, CDw70-, CD77+). Accordingly, fresh BL 
      cells obtained from three BL biopsies were APO-1 negative. EBV-positive BL cell 
      lines that had acquired a lymphoblastoid phenotype (CD10-, CD21+, CD23+, CD30+, 
      CD39+, CDw70+, CD77-) upon prolonged in vitro cultivation, as well as normal 
      B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, expressed a high density of APO-1. APO-1 may, 
      therefore, be regarded as a B-cell activation marker. APO-1 expression is not the 
      only prerequisite for anti-APO-1-induced apoptosis because 6 of 7 APO-1-expressing 
      EBV-positive BL cell lines were not sensitive to anti-APO-1, whereas all 
      lymphoblastoid cell lines were killed by anti-APO-1. The sensitivity of 
      lymphoblastoid cell lines to anti-APO-1-mediated apoptosis may open a new 
      therapeutic approach for the treatment of EBV-induced lymphoproliferative lesions in 
      immunocompromised individuals, because these are composed of cells with a 
      lymphoblastoid phenotype.

TI  - Molecular and immunophenotypic characterization of AIDS-associated, Epstein-Barr 
      virus-negative, polyclonal lymphoma.
PG  - 383-9
AB  - PURPOSE: A molecular analysis of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) from patients with 
      AIDS was undertaken to determine the prevalence and immunophenotype of polyclonal 
      B-cell lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from 40 diagnostic biopsy 
      specimens obtained from patients seen at University of California, San Francisco 
      (UCSF) between 1986 and 1990. Clonality, infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 
      and presence of a rearranged c-myc gene were determined by Southern blot analysis. 
      Lymphoma immunophenotypes were determined by frozen-section immunohistochemical 
      analysis. RESULTS: The most prevalent genotype of lymphoma in this study was that of 
      polyclonal, EBV-negative tumors with no evidence of c-myc rearrangement (14 of 40; 
      35%). Monoclonal, EBV-positive tumors with no evidence of c-myc rearrangement 
      comprised the second most prevalent class (10 of 40; 25%), and polyclonal, 
      EBV-positive tumors similar to those seen in transplant patients were observed in 
      only a small subset (three of 40; 8%) of specimens analyzed. The immunophenotype of 
      B cells in the polyclonal EBV-negative subset was equally divided into 
      B-cell-predominant and mixed-phenotype lymphomas, with the latter category 
      containing numerous infiltrating T cells. The B cells in each category were 
      immunoglobulin M-positive (IgM+), CD20+, CD21-. All but one of the polyclonal NHLs 
      had large-cell histology. CONCLUSIONS: EBV-negative, AIDS-associated, polyclonal 
      B-cell lymphoma appears to be a new class of human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV)-associated disease more prevalent in the current study than any other 
      molecular subclass. The absence of CD21, the EBV receptor, may explain in part the 
      absence of EBV within this polyclonal B-cell population.

TI  - Identification of a CD21 receptor-deficient, non-Ig-secreting peripheral B 
      lymphocyte subset in HIV-seropositive drug abusers.
PG  - 139-47
AB  - We have studied 61 HIV-seropositive heroin addicts (18 asymptomatic, 20 ARC, and 23 
      AIDS cases), 26 HIV-seronegative heroin addicts, and 45 healthy blood donors, 
      matching the groups each other for age and sex. We have focused on the phenotypic 
      characteristics of B subpopulations in the peripheral blood of HIV-seropositive and 
      -seronegative drug abusers, paying particular attention to the consistence of the 
      "CD20+" B cell subset, which poorly expresses the CD21 membrane receptor for the C3d 
      and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (referred to as "CD20 + CD21-" subset). In healthy 
      blood donors, the ratio CD20 + CD21-/CD20+ x 100 is extremely low (mean +/- SEM = 
      8.1 +/- 0.9) and rarely exceeds the value of 20. On the contrary, in HIV 
      seropositives, the values are much more dispersed, with higher mean values (mean +/- 
      SEM = 25.8 +/- 1.8) ranging from 50 to 60. An intermediate situation characterizes 
      the class of HIV-seronegative heroin addicts, whose values are slightly higher and 
      more dispersed than that of normal controls (mean +/- SEM = 11.6 +/- 1.3). The 
      extent of the amplification of the CD20 + CD21- subset in HIV-seropositive 
      individuals does not apparently correlate with the progression of the disease and 
      represents an early event in the clinical course of HIV infection. For each subject 
      of the study group, the number of CD20 + CD21- B lymphocytes is not correlated to 
      other early markers of HIV infection, as the T4 lymphocyte number, or total Ig 
      levels in sera. A functional characterization of the CD20 + CD21- B cell subset 
      indicates that, in HIV-seropositive patients, these cells are unable to produce 
      specific and nonspecific immunoglobulins (Ig's), either spontaneously or after 
      pokeweed mitogen stimulation. Furthermore, this cell subset is characterized by poor 
      expression of surface Ig's. The data reported suggest that this cell subset can be 
      regarded as situated at an early level of B cell lineage differentiation.

AB  - B-lymphocyte clones bearing an idiotypic Ig structure, which could also be found on 
      the serum M-component, have been isolated from peripheral blood of a patient with 
      monoclonal gammopathy (MG) using an immune-rosetting technique and limiting 
      dilution. The majority of the cells had the surface phenotype id+/CD19+/CD20+/CD21+ 
      or id+/CD19+/CD20+/CD21-. Some of the clones originated from spontaneous outgrowth 
      of lymphocytes and some were derived from in vitro Epstein-Barr virus-infected 
      lymphocytes. Three of the B-lymphocyte clones and the patient's bone marrow plasma 
      cells appeared to have clonal identity as shown by the same Ig heavy chain gene 
      rearrangements in Southern blot analysis using a JH probe. The study further 
      supports the notion that the peripheral blood of patients with MG contains B 
      lymphocytes that belong to the tumor clone.

TI  - Anti-B-cell monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of severe B-cell 
      lymphoproliferative syndrome following bone marrow and organ transplantation.
PG  - 1451-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome is an infrequent 
      life-threatening complication of marrow or organ transplantation that is the 
      consequence of profound immunosuppression. The results of treatment have been 
      disappointing, although a small number of patients have been cured by 
      chemoradiotherapy or antiviral agents after a reduction in the dosage of 
      immunosuppressive therapy. We report here the results of treating this disorder with 
      anti-B-cell antibodies. METHODS: Twenty-six patients in whom aggressive B-cell 
      lymphoproliferative syndrome developed after bone marrow (n = 14) or organ (n = 12) 
      transplantation received 0.2 mg of CD21-specific and of CD24-specific antibodies per 
      kilogram of body weight for 10 consecutive days in an open, prospective, multicenter 
      trial. RESULTS: The treatment was well tolerated. All patients had transient 
      neutropenia, apparently because the CD24 molecule is also expressed on granulocytes. 
      The treatment was ineffective in seven patients with monoclonal B-cell 
      proliferation. In contrast, 16 patients with oligoclonal B-cell proliferation had 
      complete remission. Systemic remission also occurred in two other patients with 
      oligoclonal proliferation who had central nervous system involvement, although they 
      subsequently died because of progression of the central nervous system disease. In 
      one patient who died early, clonality was not determined. Of the 16 patients who had 
      complete remission, 2 with persistent immunodeficiency due to graft (marrow) 
      rejection or acute graft-versus-host disease had a relapse, and the 1 with 
      graft-versus-host disease subsequently died. Eleven patients were alive and 
      disease-free after a median follow-up of 35 months (5 of 14 marrow recipients and 6 
      of 12 organ recipients). Four other patients in complete remission died of unrelated 
      causes 4 to 12 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous administration of 
      anti-B-cell antibodies may be effective in controlling diffuse, severe, oligoclonal 
      B-cell proliferation not involving the central nervous system.

TI  - Primary anterior mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. A clinicopathologic and 
      immunohistochemical study of 16 cases.
PG  - 2579-87
AB  - Sixteen cases of primary anterior mediastinal B-cell lymphoma were characterized by 
      morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical profiles. Twelve were men and four were 
      women. The median age was 42 years. Virtually all tumors were of large cell type. 
      Three main morphologic categories were identified, with one rare exception. In some 
      tumors, the cells were compatible with centrocytes and centroblasts (four). Others 
      had cells readily identifiable as centroblasts (six). Both these groups had a 
      variable proportion of cells with multilobed nuclei. A third group was composed 
      mainly of unclassifiable cells with multilobed nuclei (five). All had discernible 
      sclerosis of varying intensity. A wider range of morphologic features and different 
      sex distribution was noticed in comparison with previously reported clear cell 
      features and younger women. The dominant phenotype of these B-cell lymphomas was 
      CD19+, CD22+, CD37+, CD21-, CD30-, CD10-, CD5-, and Ig-negative. The finding of 
      CD21-, Ig-negative phenotype, as observed by the authors and others, overlaps with 
      some high-grade lymphomas of follicular center cell origin but is thought to bear 
      similarity to a noncirculating population of thymic medullary B-cells. The tumors 
      attained large size without peripheral dissemination and responded to chemotherapy 
      as well as radiotherapy.

AB  - Mediastinal clear cell lymphoma (MCCL) is regarded as a distinct subtype of 
      Non-Hodgkin's-lymphoma. We have analyzed gene rearrangements of eight cases of newly 
      diagnosed MCCL in order to verify their alignment to the B-cell lineage as suggested 
      by immunotyping. The lymphoma cells shared a common immunophenotype which consisted 
      of CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, and CD21-. Rearrangements of the heavy chain of the 
      immunoglobulin gene were found in all eight cases studied. In contrast, the beta 
      chain of the T-cell antigen receptor gene was not rearranged. No rearrangements of 
      the kappa light chain gene were detected. There was no evidence for a t(14;18) or a 
      t(8;14). In conclusion, MCCL seems to be a B-cell derived tumor, which is distinct 
      from other known lymphomas both by its immunophenotype and genotype.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 activates transcription of the terminal protein 
      gene.
PG  - 415-23
AB  - Transcription of the terminal protein (TP) gene of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in 
      Burkitt's lymphoma cells, in EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cells converted with 
      transformation-defective (P3HR1) and transformation-competent (B95-8, AG876) EBV 
      strains, and in EBV-immortalized cell lines was studied. A TP1 cDNA probe spanning 
      the boundary between exons 1 and 2 and discriminating between TP1 and TP2 
      transcripts was used for S1 analysis. TP RNA expression varied widely in Burkitt's 
      lymphoma cells. TP-specific transcripts were not detectable or only hardly 
      detectable in Burkitt's lymphoma cells with the group I phenotype (CD10+ CD77+ CD21- 
      CD23- CD30- CDw70-) as well as in P3HR1 virus-converted Burkitt's lymphoma lines. TP 
      expression was high in Burkitt's lymphoma lines with the group II and group III 
      phenotypes (CD21+ CD23+ CD30+ CDw70+), in B95-8 and AG876 virus-converted lines, and 
      in EBV-immortalized cells. Detection of TP1 RNA correlated with EBNA2 expression. 
      TP1 transcription was shown to be dependent on EBNA2 expression by stable 
      transfection of an EBNA2 expression vector into P3HR1 virus-converted BL41 cells. 
      EBNA2 is activating the TP1 as well as the TP2 promoter, as shown by the analysis of 
      TP promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs transiently transfected 
      into EBNA2-positive and EBNA2-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cells.

TI  - Tissue distribution of the C3d/EBV-receptor: CD21 monoclonal antibodies reactive 
      with a variety of epithelial cells, medullary thymocytes, and peripheral T-cells.
PG  - 605-11
AB  - The CD21 antigen has been described to represent CR2, the receptor for the 
      complement fragment C3d and also the receptor for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). 
      Monoclonal antibodies B2, HB5, and B-ly4 belong to the CD21 cluster, recognizing 
      different epitopes of the CD21-molecule. Immunohistology of lymphoid tissues 
      employing these antibodies showed the known staining of B cells and dendritic 
      reticulum cells. Surprisingly, B2, but not HB5 or B-ly4, stained a distinct spot in 
      the cytoplasm of a major proportion of medullary thymocytes, in almost all 
      peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in a substantial amount of cells in T-cell areas 
      of peripheral lymphoid tissues. This distinct cytoplasmic B2 staining was confirmed 
      by immuno-electronmicroscopy. A similar B2+ cytoplasmic dot was observed in 
      B-lymphoblastic lymphomas. Staining of non-lymphoid tissues showed reactivity with 
      all three CD21 mAb with epithelial cells of skin, lung, esophagus, jejunum, colon, 
      pancreas, tonsil, adrenal cortex, renal tubuli, and parotid glands, and with 
      hepatocytes and tongue muscle. In addition, endothelial cells of small vessels 
      showed B2 staining. One possible explanation for our results is, that apart from the 
      presence of B cells and follicular dendritic cells, a CD21-molecule may be expressed 
      by other cell types. However, a maybe more likely explanation may be that the 
      recognized epitopes are not exclusively associated with the C3d/EBV-receptor, but 
      also with other structures. In particular should the possibility be recognized of 
      cross-reactivity with CR2-related proteins, encoded by the large gene family, to 
      which CR2 belongs.

TI  - The CD24 antigen discriminates between pre-B and B cells in human bone marrow.
PG  - 3678-83
AB  - When bone marrow (BM) lymphoid cells from 12 adult healthy donors were labeled by 
      CD24 antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry, two positive populations of cells 
      were demonstrated in each sample (by a separated bimodal specific 
      immunofluorescence). One population had intermediate CD24-Ag density (termed CD24+ 
      cells) whereas the other had high CD24-Ag density (termed CD24(2+) cells). CD24+ 
      cells represented 5.8 +/- 2.7% of the total lymphoid BM cells and CD24(2+) cells 5.6 
      +/- 2.5%. Using dual fluorescence analysis on eight samples, all CD24+ cells 
      expressed the CD21 and CD37 mature B cell Ag and also surface IgM (sIgM), but this 
      population lacked CD10 Ag. These cells also expressed CD19 Ag, and at a higher 
      density than CD24(2+) cells. They were also positive for HLA-DR Ag. Conversely, 
      CD24(2+) cells were shown to be early cells of the B cell lineage. While all the 
      CD24(2+) cells were HLA-DR+ and CD19+, 64 +/- 16% of them expressed CD20 Ag (at a 
      lower density than CD24+ cells), 65 +/- 21% CD10 Ag, and 22 +/- 8% were positive for 
      cytoplasmic mu-chains (c mu). None of these cells expressed the CD21 and CD37 mature 
      B cell Ag or sIgM. Additional experiments on four different healthy donors 
      demonstrated that 30 +/- 9% of the CD24(2+) cells expressed the CD34 Ag and that the 
      CD24+ cells did not express it. Thus, the CD24 Ag permits discrimination between two 
      populations of the B cell lineage present in adult BM: 1) A CD24(2+) cell population 
      including "pre" pre-B cells (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10+/-, CD20-, CD21-, CD34+, CD37-, c 
      mu-), "intermediate" pre-B cells (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10+, CD20+, CD21-, CD34-, CD37-, 
      c mu-), and "true" pre-B cells (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10+, CD20+, CD21-, CD34-, CD37-, c 
      mu+). 2) A CD24+ cell population including B cells of the standard phenotype 
      (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10-, CD20+, CD21+, CD34-, CD37+, c mu-, sIgM+).

TI  - Genotypic and immunophenotypic characterization of two human light chain-only B-cell 
      non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
PG  - 390-6
AB  - Two atypical human non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) that exhibited unusual genotypic 
      and in situ immunophenotypic abnormalities are described. Immunophenotypically, both 
      NHLs lacked surface Ig heavy chains. With the exception of the MB2 B-cell-associated 
      antigen, no B- and T-cell differentiation antigen was detected in case 1. NHL 2 
      failed to show evidence of clonality by immunohistochemical analysis but revealed 
      the presence of many B-lymphocytes with an abnormal phenotypic profile: CD19+, 
      CD20+, CD22+, kappa-, lambda-, CD9-, CD10-, CD21-, and CD24-. Genotypic analysis 
      indicated that both lymphomas derived from anomalously matured pre-B-cells that had 
      rearranged the lambda or kappa light chain genes but not the Ig heavy chain gene. 
      The neoplastic cells of the two NHLs resemble the light chain-only B-cells recently 
      discovered, following Epstein-Barr virus immortalization, in the human bone marrow. 
      The authors' data confirm, therefore, the existence of the light chain-only B-cells 
      in the human hematopoietic compartment. Moreover, their results emphasize the 
      conclusive role of the immunogenotypic analysis in defining clonality, lineage, and 
      maturation abnormalities of such atypical NHLs.

TI  - Immunophenotype of hairy-cell leukemia.
PG  - 172-6
AB  - 15 cases of HCL were studied with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against different 
      leukocyte antigens. A B-cell phenotype different from that of B-CLL was observed 
      (CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD21-, CD22+, CD37+, CD38-, FMC7+, LN1+, PCA-1+, BLy7+ and 
      CD5-). As expected, CD11c and CD25 were positive and, in addition, a My7 and My9 
      positivity in varying degree was noted. 3 weeks of in vitro incubation did not 
      significantly alter the phenotype. We conclude that HCL exhibits a unique phenotype 
      among chronic B-cell leukemias, which is closer to the plasma cell stage of 
      differentiation than that of B-CLL. The BLy7 monoclonal antibody seems to be a 
      promising marker for HCL.

TI  - A phenotypic study of B lymphocyte subpopulations in human bone marrow.
PG  - 166-72
AB  - The regulatory mechanisms that monitor the size of the peripheral B cell pool and 
      determine cell death or survival are poorly understood. In rodents B lymphopoiesis 
      is maintained at a high rate throughout adult life, and under resting conditions 
      there is little recruitment into the long-lived peripheral pool; it therefore 
      follows that most newly formed B lymphocytes have a very short lifespan. The 
      maturation stages of B lymphopoiesis in humans and in experimental mammals appear to 
      be similar. We have determined the phenotype of sIgM- and sIgD-expressing cells from 
      normal adult human bone-marrow and peripheral blood by dual immunofluorescence with 
      an extensive panel of monoclonal antibodies representative of major B cell clusters, 
      in order to identify antigenic differences that may play a regulatory role. 
      Antibodies of the CD21, CD22 and CD9 clusters, the unclustered restricted B antibody 
      7-F-7 and anti-IgD were reactive with different proportions of sIgM+ cells in blood 
      and bone marrow; 29.5% (range 5-60%) of sIgM+ cells in marrow were sIgD- and most of 
      these cells were also CD21- and CD22-, thus defining a unique marrow population. 
      However, newly formed and mature re-circulating cells comprising the sIgM+sIgD+ 
      population could not be distinguished by the panel of antibodies.

TI  - Immaturity of the human splenic marginal zone in infancy. Possible contribution to 
      the deficient infant immune response.
PG  - 3200-6
AB  - The immune response to polysaccharide Ag as present in the capsule of certain 
      virulent bacteria has been demonstrated to be related to a functionally intact 
      spleen. This immune response is almost completely defective in infancy. Because of 
      this the development of cellular compartments in the human spleen was studied 
      immunohistologically in frozen and paraffin tissue sections of 32 infant spleens 
      (less than 2 y of age) and 6 spleens from children. Six cases of sudden infant death 
      syndrome and 7 cases of infection or sepsis which were included showed no 
      significant differences compared to the other cases. Whereas all other cellular 
      compartments have completed their maturation to an adult-type immunophenotype and 
      morphology within the first 5 mo, the infant marginal zone B cells show essentially 
      different features compared to the adult situation. The main characteristics of the 
      infant marginal zone B cells are the absence of CD21-(C3d/EBV-R) expression and the 
      high percentage of cells strongly coexpressing IgM and IgD. As the marginal zone is 
      supposed to be the site of the initiation of the immune response to polysaccharide 
      Ag, there is a remarkable coincidence between the first appearance of MZ B cells 
      with adult features, and the time of acquisition of the ability to mount an immune 
      response to polysaccharides, including encapsulated bacteria.

TI  - Abnormal B lymphocyte function in thyroid glands from patients with Graves' disease.
PG  - 939-45
AB  - Thyroid-infiltrating B lymphocytes from patients with Graves' disease were 
      investigated in regard to their phenotypic profiles, cell size, cell cycle status, 
      proliferative response to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 (SAC), and spontaneous 
      production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antithyroidal autoantibodies. Thyroid 
      tissues and peripheral blood were obtained at the time of subtotal thyroidectomy of 
      27 Graves' patients who had been treated with thionamide drugs and iodide before 
      operation. Two intrathyroidal mononuclear cell populations were obtained from these 
      thyroid tissues. One cell population was isolated from the supernatants after 
      mechanical disaggregation of the tissues and was defined as TG-1 cells. Another cell 
      population, defined as TG-2 cells, was isolated from the supernatants of overnight 
      cultures of the thyroid debris after enzymatic digestion. The percentages of B 
      lymphocytes bearing activated markers and plasma cells (CD20+CD21-, IgM+IgD-, CD20+ 
      transferrin receptor+, PCA-1+) were significantly higher in the TG-1 and TG-2 cell 
      populations than in peripheral blood from Graves' disease patients and normal 
      subjects. These phenotypic changes were accompanied by increased thyroid gland B 
      lymphocyte cell size from patients with Graves' disease. The proliferative response 
      of B lymphocytes to SAC was markedly lower in TG-1 and TG-2 cell populations than in 
      peripheral blood cells from Graves' disease patients and normal subjects. B 
      lymphocytes isolated from thyroid glands secreted significantly more IgG and 
      antithyroidal autoantibodies than those from peripheral blood. Based on the findings 
      of abnormalities in thyroid-infiltrating B lymphocytes, we suggest that activated B 
      lymphocytes may induce the excessive production of antithyroidal autoantibodies in 
      thyroid glands from patients with Graves' disease.

TI  - [Burkitt's lymphoma of the stomach associated with macroglobulinemia].
PG  - 1016-20
AB  - We report a 35-year-old male with leukemic change and gastric involvement of 
      Burkitt's lymphoma. A monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig), IgM-kappa, was detected in the 
      serum by means of immunoelectrophoresis. Immunophenotypical analysis showed that the 
      neoplastic cells were CD20+, OKIal+, CD10-, CD21-, surface Ig+ (M-kappa), and 
      cytoplasmic Ig-. The neoplastic cells did not secret Ig by using of protein A plaque 
      forming cell assay. Active transcription of Ig heavy chain genes was not detected by 
      cell dot analysis of the neoplastic cells. These findings support the possibility 
      that the presence of the monoclonal Ig in the serum does not result from secretion 
      of Ig from the neoplastic cells. The shedding of surface Ig from the neoplastic 
      cells might result in the occurrence of monoclonal Ig in the serum.

TI  - Biphenotypic leukemic lymphocyte precursors in CD2+CD19+ acute lymphoblastic 
      leukemia and their putative normal counterparts in human fetal hematopoietic 
      tissues.
PG  - 1000-15
AB  - During detailed immunophenotypic analyses of marrow blasts from 336 acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, a very small percentage of cases reactive 
      with B-cell-directed as well as T-cell-directed monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were 
      identified. Five ALL cases were biphenotypic since they coexpressed CD2 (Tp50) and 
      CD19 (Bp95) antigens at the single-cell level. The composite immunophenotype of 
      these biphenotypic ALL cases was [TdT+HLA-ABC+CD2+CD3-CD10+CD13-CD14-CD16-CD19+CD20+ 
      ++-CD21-CD33-CD34+Bgp95-C mu- slg-]. Low-molecular-weight B-cell growth factor 
      (LMW-BCGF), recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2), and rIL-3 stimulated the 
      proliferative activity of biphenotypic leukemic lymphocyte precursors without 
      inducing differentiation. In the presence of the phorbol ester TPA, leukemic blasts 
      from two cases differentiated along the B precursor pathway to the 
      [CD2-CD10+CD19+CD20+C mu+slg-] pre-B cell stage. Biphenotypic ALL cases did not 
      share a common configuration and gene rearrangement pattern of the immunoglobulin 
      heavy chain genes or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. Three cases had rearranged C mu 
      genes but germline TCR genes, one case showed rearrangement of both C mu and TCR 
      genes, and the remaining case had rearranged TCR genes but germline C mu genes. All 
      five patients attained prompt remission after standard induction chemotherapy. Three 
      to four years after initial diagnosis, four patients are now off chemotherapy and 
      remain alive in their first remission. One patient relapsed at 3 years, 7 months, 
      but promptly achieved complete remission after reinduction chemotherapy and remains 
      in second remission off chemotherapy greater than 3 years after her reinduction 
      therapy. With two-color immunofluorescence staining techniques and multiparameter 
      flow cytometric analyses, we identified a small population of CD2+CD19+ lymphoid 
      cells in fetal livers (FLs) and fetal bone marrows (FBMs), which may represent the 
      putative normal counterparts of biphenotypic ALL blasts. A CD2+CD19+ normal 
      biphenotypic lymphoid precursor cell line, designated FL 8.2 CD2+, was established 
      from an FL of 8-weeks of gestational age by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced 
      blastoid transformation. The composite immunophenotype of FL 8.2 CD2+ cell line was 
      [TdT+HLA-ABC+HLA-DR+ CD2+CD5-CD7-CD10+/-CD13-CD19+CD20-CD21+ 
      CD22+CD33-CD34+/-Bgp95-CDw40+C mu-slgD-slgM-]. FL 8.2 CD2+ cells showed germline 
      patterns of immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region, heavy-chain constant region, 
      kappa light-chain constant region genes, and TCR beta-chain genes. Cross-linking of 
      CD2 as well as CD19 antigens on FL 8.2 CD2+ cells caused an increase of 
      intracellular ionized calcium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

PG  - 10-6
AB  - Using 14 well-defined (clustered) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against B-cell 
      restricted/associated differentiation and activation (CD) antigens and 12 
      mediastinal clear-cell lymphomas (MCCL), 46 follicular-center-cell lymphomas (FCCL), 
      and 20 non-neoplastic lymph nodes--including toxoplasmic and HIV-associated 
      lymphadenitis--were immunohistochemically examined to determine the histogenesis of 
      MCCL. Antigenically, MCCL was characterized as CD5-, CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD21-, 
      CD22+, CD30-, CD37+, CDw40+, and by a frequent expression of CD11c and CD23, while 
      other antigens were inconsistently expressed. The antigenic profiles of MCCL and 
      FCCL showed statistically significant differences in 4/14 distinct antigens. When 
      the neoplastic cells of both tumor groups were compared with morphologically defined 
      normal B-cell types, the overall resemblance of their immunophenotypes was even 
      closer between MCCL and sinusoidal (monocytoid) B cells than between FCCL and 
      follicular-center B cells. We conclude that MCCL is a lymphoma type distinct from 
      FCCL, most probably representing a highly malignant neoplasm corresponding to 
      sinusoidal B-cell reaction.

TI  - Transition in CD45 isoform expression during differentiation of normal and abnormal 
      B cells.
PG  - 229-36
AB  - We have demonstrated a transition in the expression of CD45 isoforms, from the 
      expression of the high molecular weight CD45R to the low molecular weight CD45 p180 
      isoform on normal and on monoclonal (possibly malignant) B cells undergoing 
      differentiation into plasma cells. The differentiation into plasma cells was shown 
      by the loss of CD20 and CD21 surface antigens, a reduced expression, but in our 
      system not a complete loss, of CD19, and the expression of the plasma cell marker 
      PCA-1. We used three-color immunofluorescence to demonstrate the shift from CD45R to 
      CD45 p180 on CD19+CD20-CD21- cells in cultures of normal cells stimulated by 
      pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Furthermore, tissue sections of extramedullary 
      plasmacytomas, where plasma cells were defined by morphology and expression of 
      cytoplasmic Ig, showed a complete loss of CD45R and CD45 p180 antigens, although the 
      cells retained expression of CD45 common determinants. Finally, we have analysed 
      PBMC from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) at various stages of 
      disease, and demonstrated that the monoclonal B cell subset present in their 
      peripheral blood is heterogeneous in the expression of CD45 isoforms, including 
      cells bearing only CD45R, those with a transitional CD45R+CD45 p180+ phenotype, and 
      those expressing only CD45 p180. Upon stimulation in vitro these cells show greatly 
      increased expression of CD45 p180. The differential expression of CD45 isoforms 
      within a clonal B cell subset in the blood of these patients suggests that the 
      monoclonal B cells in WM represent a continuously differentiating lineage of CD45R+ 
      mature B cells giving rise to CD45 p180+ pre-plasma cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Immunophenotyping of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Correlation with relapse-free survival.
PG  - 102-11
AB  - In a retrospective analysis the authors studied the relation between the immunologic 
      phenotype of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and disease-free survival. The 
      phenotype included immunoglobulin isotypes; B-cell maturation/differentiation 
      antigens of clusters of differentiation CD9, CD10, CD19-24, CD37, CD38; T-lymphocyte 
      antigens in CD5-7; HLA-DR; peanut agglutinin binding capacity; terminal 
      deoxynucleotidyl transferase; the activation marker CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor); 
      and the proliferation marker transferrin receptor. The phenotype and clinical data 
      were available for 109 patients. Two patients underwent bone marrow transplantation, 
      and 15 patients (with low or intermediate grade NHL) did not receive treatment 
      intended to achieve complete remission. These 17 cases were excluded from the 
      analysis. For individual markers, CD23 expression was associated with a longer 
      actuarial disease-free survival (50% survival in CD23-positive cases was 40 months; 
      and in CD23-negative cases, 16 months; P = 0.01). Among the total study population 
      of 92 patients, this finding applied in particular to those with a low-grade 
      malignancy according to the Kiel classification (P = 0.03). In high-grade NHL (Kiel 
      classification) the absence of CD38 or presence of CD24 on tumor cells correlated 
      with a higher degree of disease-free survival (P values 0.009 and 0.04, 
      respectively). For a combination of five CD markers associated with stages in 
      physiologic B-lymphocyte maturation/differentiation (CD9, CD10, CD21-23), the lowest 
      measure of disease-free survival was observed where NHLs were at an immature stage, 
      and the greatest extent of survival where NHLs were associated with a resting B-cell 
      stage (P = 0.006). These statistical significances aside, the detailed immunologic 
      phenotyping has relatively little prognostic value when compared with that of the 
      malignancy grade assessed by conventional histopathology.

TI  - Treatment of severe Epstein-Barr virus-induced polyclonal B-lymphocyte proliferation 
      by anti-B-cell monoclonal antibodies. Two cases after HLA-mismatched bone marrow 
      transplantation.
PG  - 199-203
AB  - We treated two children who developed Epstein-Barr virus-induced polyclonal B-cell 
      proliferation after HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplantation for congenital 
      immunodeficiency with two monoclonal anti-B-cell antibodies. Lymphoproliferative 
      syndrome occurred between 50 and 60 days after bone marrow infusion, and was 
      diagnosed by the presence of spontaneously growing B cells containing 
      Epstein-Barr-nuclear antigen in the blood and bone marrow. The mouse monoclonal 
      anti-B-cell antibodies used were a CD21-specific antibody recognizing the CR2 
      receptor on B cells (BL13, IgG1) and a CD24-specific antibody binding B cells at all 
      steps of differentiation (ALB9 IgG1). Both antibodies were given intravenously (0.2 
      mg/kg/body weight.d for 10 days). All clinical and biological manifestations 
      resolved within 3 weeks of treatment. Recurrence was not seen at 18- and 15-month 
      follow-ups. T-cell function developed normally; B-cell function remained partially 
      deficient in one patient 21 months after bone marrow transplantation. These results 
      suggest that monoclonal anti-B-cell antibodies could be useful in controlling severe 
      polyclonal lymphoproliferative syndrome in profoundly immunodeficient patients after 
      bone marrow transplantation.

TI  - Intra- and extrathymic B cells in physiologic and pathologic conditions. 
      Immunohistochemical study on normal thymus and lymphofollicular hyperplasia of the 
      thymus.
PG  - 431-42
AB  - Normal thymuses and thymuses with lymphofollicular hyperplasia have been examined 
      immunohistologically using immunoenzymatic single and double labelling methods and a 
      panel of monoclonal antibodies against B lymphocyte differentiation antigens (CD19-, 
      CD20-, CD21-, CD22-, CD23- and CD37ag) and human immunoglobulins (IgM, IgD) for the 
      presence and localisation of B lymphocytes and cells expressing B cell 
      differentiation antigens. The numerous hyperplastic lymph follicles which occur in 
      the pathological condition of lymphofollicular hyperplasia of the thymus were found 
      to originate in the extrathymic compartment of the interlobular septal space. This 
      area was found to be blown up by the growing lymph follicles with exactly the same 
      cellular composition as their counterparts in the peripheral lymphatic tissue. Some 
      of the B lymphocytes expressing the immunophenotype of follicular mantle zone 
      lymphocytes which were detected in the thymic medulla probably infiltrated through 
      discontinuities of the border between the perivascular space and the thymic medulla. 
      Apart from this primarily extrathymic B cell compartment, B lymphocytes and cells 
      expressing B cell antigens were found within the thymus medulla of normal control 
      thymuses of different ages from fetal to adult life. These cells were detected as a 
      small subpopulation in normal fetal, juvenile and adult thymuses. Morphologically 
      they could be subdivided into small, round lymphoid cells accounting for less than 
      1% of medullary lymphoid cells, and into a larger variant, asteroidally shaped 
      because of short cytoplasmic processes. These asteroid cells were even more 
      infrequent than the lymphoid variant. Immunophenotype (CD19ag+, CD20ag+, CD22ag+, 
      CD37ag+, IgM+, IgD+) and morphology of the first cell type led to the conclusion 
      that the lymphoid cells were in fact B lymphocytes. They were scattered throughout 
      the medulla of fetal and juvenile and adult thymuses alike. The second, the asteroid 
      cell type, constantly expressed CD20ag and inconstantly IgM, CD22ag and CD37ag; 
      furthermore, CD23ag was detected in a subset of the asteroid cells either restricted 
      to the perinuclear zone or expressed in the entire cytoplasma and on the plasma 
      membrane. The asteroid cells were located in the corticomedullary region of the 
      fetal thymuses but were randomly distributed with a tendency to Hassall's corpuscles 
      in juvenile and adult thymuses. They often formed rosettes with non-B 
      lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Mediastinal lymphoma of clear cell type is a tumor corresponding to terminal steps 
      of B cell differentiation.
PG  - 1087-95
AB  - This article reports eight primary mediastinal tumors occurring in young adults (19 
      to 43 years, mean 29.4 years), predominantly female (six of eight) adults. Most 
      patients responded badly to aggressive therapy. Progression is presently noted in 
      one patient; five patients died 10, 11, 13, 18, and 22 months after diagnosis. No 
      patient developed leukemia. The tumors were highly proliferative, had a diffuse 
      growth pattern, and comprised clear cells of variable size. They could not be 
      classified histologically, but could, however, be immunohistologically characterized 
      as B cell lymphomas. In all cases, the immunophenotype was LC+, cALLa-, CD19+, 
      CD20+, CD21-, Ig (surface/cytoplasm)-, and PC-1+. In addition, the neoplastic cells 
      exhibited variable defects in the expression of HLA-A,B,C and HLA-DR and inconstant 
      expression of other B cell-restricted/associated antigens. This combination of 
      immunophenotypical and clinical features suggests that the mediastinal clear cell 
      lymphoma (MCCL) is a previously undescribed type of B cell lymphoma corresponding to 
      the terminal steps of B cell differentiation.
