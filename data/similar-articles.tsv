TI  - Clinical outcomes of all-ceramic single crowns and fixed dental prostheses
      supported by ceramic implants: A systematic review and meta-analyses.
PG  - 1-20

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical outcomes of all-ceramic single crowns (SCs)
      and fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) supported by ceramic implants. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Based on a focused question and customized PICO framework, electronic
      (Medline/EMBASE/Cochrane) and manual searches for studies reporting the clinical 
      outcomes of all-ceramic SCs and FDPs supported by ceramic implants >/=12 months
      were performed. The primary outcomes were reconstruction survival and the
      chipping proportion. The secondary outcomes were implant survival, technical
      complications, and patient-related outcome measurements. Meta-analyses were
      performed after 1, 2, and 5 years using random-effect meta-analyses. RESULTS:
      Eight of the 1,403 initially screened titles and 55 full texts were included.
      Five reported on monolithic lithium disilicate (LS2) SCs, one on veneered
      zirconia SCs, and two on veneered zirconia SCs and FDPs, which reported all on
      cement-retained reconstructions (mean observation: 12.0-61.0 months).
      Meta-analyses estimated a 5-year survival rate of 94% (95% confidence interval
      [CI]: 82%-100%) for overall implant survival. Reconstruction survival proportions
      after 5 years were: monolithic LS2, 100% (95%CI: 95%-100%); veneered zirconia
      SCs, 89% (95%CI: 62%-100%); and veneered zirconia FDPs 94% (95%CI: 81%-100%). The
      chipping proportion after 5 years was: monolithic LS2, 2% (95%CI: 0%-11%);
      veneered zirconia SCs, 38% (95%CI: 24%-54%); and veneered zirconia FDPs, 57%
      (95%CI: 38%-76%). Further outcomes were summarized descriptively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Due to the limited data available, only tendencies could be identified.
      All-ceramic reconstructions supported by ceramic implants demonstrated promising 
      survival rates after mid-term observation. However, high chipping proportions of 
      veneered zirconia SCs and, particularly, FDPs diminished the overall outcome.
      Monolithic LS2 demonstrated fewer clinical complications. Monolithic
      reconstructions could be a valid treatment option for ceramic implants.

TI  - Clinical Performance of CAD/CAM All-Ceramic Tooth-Supported Fixed Dental
      Prostheses: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 2672 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma14102672 [doi]
AB  - Although CAD/CAM ceramics present a promising alternative to metal-ceramic fixed 
      dental prostheses, little is known about their mid- and long-term clinical
      performance. This systematic review aims to estimate the survival and success
      rates and describes the underlying complication characteristics for CAD/CAM
      tooth-supported zirconia- and lithium disilicate-based fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs). We systematically searched MEDLINE and Web of Science to find relevant
      prospective studies with a follow-up of at least one year. We estimated pooled
      1-, 5-, and 10-year survival and success rates by combining the collected data in
      a Poisson regression model. Descriptive statistics were conducted to evaluate the
      distribution of failures and complications in the included studies. Risk of bias 
      for the included studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for single-arm
      trials. Pooled estimated 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates ranged from 93.80% to
      94.66%, 89.67% to 91.1%, and 79.33% to 82.20%, respectively. The corresponding
      success rates excluding failures, but including any other types of intervention
      were 94.53% to 96.77%, 90.89% to 94.62%, and 81.78% to 89.25%. Secondary caries
      was the most frequent cause of failure, followed by chipping of the veneering.
      The most common cause of complication excluding failures but requiring
      intervention was chipping of the veneering. Risk of bias was generally acceptable
      for the included studies, with seven studies associated with low risk of bias,
      eight studies with a moderate risk of bias, and three studies with serious risk
      of bias. The current meta-analysis on CAD/CAM-supported FDPs revealed satisfying 
      survival and success rates for up to 10 years of exposure. More prospective
      studies focusing on long-term performance are needed to strengthen the evidence
      currently available in the literature.

TI  - Survival and complications of monolithic ceramic for tooth-supported fixed dental
      prostheses: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - S0022-3913(21)00065-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.01.020 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Although recent studies have reported the success of
      implant-supported monolithic restorations, consensus on the use of monolithic
      ceramic restorations is lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review
      and meta-analysis was to evaluate the survival and biological and technical
      complication rates of monolithic single crowns and fixed partial dentures (FPDs).
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search was conducted by 2 independent authors
      on the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases. The
      Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool were used to assess the
      quality and risk of bias of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed by 
      using the R software program. RESULTS: The search identified 763 articles, 18 of 
      which met the eligibility criteria. A total of 15 studies evaluated monolithic
      ceramic single crowns, and 4 studies evaluated FPDs. The studies included 1061
      monolithic single crowns (524 lithium disilicate, 461 zirconia, and 76
      polymer-infiltrated ceramic network [PICN]) and 104 FPDs (36 lithium disilicate
      and 68 zirconia). Meta-analysis of single-arm studies indicated the proportion of
      survival, biological, and technical complication rates of 1% (95% confidence
      interval [CI]: 0% to 3%), 1% (CI: 0% to 4%), and 2% (CI: 1% to 4%), respectively,
      for single crowns, independent of ceramic material, and 3% (CI: 0% to 34%), 5%
      (CI: 1% to 21%), and 5% (CI: 1% to 21%) for FPDs, respectively. Only 5 studies
      performed a direct comparison between monolithic and veneered ceramic
      restorations, and no significant difference was observed in terms of survival
      (risk ratio [RR]: 0.68; CI: 0.25-1.91; P=.96), biological (RR: 0.69; CI:
      0.31-1.53; P=.35), and technical complication rates (RR: 0.87; CI: 0.40-1.88;
      P=.29). CONCLUSIONS: The use of monolithic ceramic can be considered a favorable 
      treatment for tooth-supported single crowns and FPDs, with high survival and low 
      complication rates. However, further randomized controlled trials are needed to
      reassess these clinical performances, mainly by comparing them with the
      performance of veneered restorations.

TI  - Marginal and internal adaptation of lithium disilicate partial restorations: A
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 338-344
LID - 10.4103/jips.jips_112_20 [doi]
AB  - Aim: The aim of this meta analysis was to evaluate the influence of the
      processing method on the marginal and internal gaps of lithium disilicate
      inlays/onlays. Settings and Design: A systematic literature review was conducted 
      using the PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases. This
      review was registered on the PROSPERO platform. Materials and Methods: The
      studies were selected according to the marginal and internal gaps of two
      different fabrication methods for lithium disilicate (milled and pressed).
      Statistical Analysis Used: The meta analysis was performed based on the
      Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance methods, using the random effects model and 
      a 95% confidence interval. Results: From all databases, 127 studies were
      identified. Four in vitro studies were included in the qualitative analysis and
      three in the meta analysis. Moreover, 197 restorations were evaluated (103
      pressed and 94 milled). During the evaluation of only the internal gap, there was
      a statistically significant difference favoring the pressed technique (P =
      0.002). There was no statistically significant difference in the analyses of the 
      marginal gap (P = 0.530) and the total gap (P = 0.450). Conclusion: Both the
      techniques provided acceptable marginal and total gaps, although the pressed
      technique revealed a more favorable internal adaptation than the milled
      onlays/inlays.

TI  - Clinical Behavior of Ceramic, Hybrid and Composite Onlays. A Systematic Review
      and Meta-Analysis.
LID - E7582 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17207582 [doi]
AB  - A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to analyze the survival of
      onlay restorations in the posterior region, their clinical behavior according to 
      the material used (ceramic reinforced with lithium disilicate, conventional
      feldspathic ceramic or reinforced with leucite; hybrid materials and composite), 
      possible complications, and the factors influencing restoration success. The
      systematic review was based on the preferred reporting items for systematic
      reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement, without publication date or
      language restrictions. An electronic search was made in the PubMed, Scopus,
      Embase, and Cochrane databases. After discarding duplicate publications and
      studies that failed to meet the inclusion criteria, the articles were selected
      based on the population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) question. The
      following variables were considered in the qualitative and quantitative analyses:
      restoration survival rate (determined by several clinical parameters), the
      influence of the material used upon the clinical behavior of the restorations,
      and the complications recorded over follow-up. A total of 29 articles were
      selected for the qualitative analysis and 27 for the quantitative analysis. The
      estimated restoration survival rate was 94.2%. The predictors of survival were
      the duration of follow-up (beta = -0.001; p = 0.001) and the onlay material used 
      (beta = -0.064; p = 0.028). Composite onlays were associated with a lower
      survival rate over time. Onlays are a good, conservative, and predictable option 
      for restoring dental defects in the posterior region, with a survival rate of
      over 90%. The survival rate decreases over time and with the use of composite as 
      onlay material.

AB  - The use of ceramic materials and the computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology for the fabrication of complete-coverage
      restorations has significantly increased in the last decade. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate the survival rate of anterior and posterior monolithic and 
      bilayered lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LDGC) CAD/CAM crowns, and to identify
      the types of complications associated with the main clinical outcomes reported in
      clinical trials. MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane
      Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched by 2 independent reviewers for
      clinical studies published between 2006 and 2019, following the Preferred
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The 
      electronic search was supplemented by a hand search. Quality assessment for the
      included studies was performed. Qualitative and quantitative data was extracted
      from each study. Out of 219 studies, 6 studies that evaluated LDGC CAD/CAM crowns
      were identified and used for data extraction. The included studies had 154
      participants, who received 204 crowns. The shortto medium-term survival and
      success rates were high. Biological complications occurred more frequently than
      technical complications. No esthetic complications were reported. This review
      indicated that the medium-term survival rate of LDGC CAD/CAM crowns was high.
      Further multicenter studies with longer follow-ups and larger sample sizes are
      needed in order to augment the data already in existence.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The restoration of extensively damaged endodontically
      treated teeth remains a challenge. The use of post-retained restorations has been
      questioned because of potential tooth weakening. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      systematic review was to determine whether endocrowns are a reliable alternative 
      to post-retained restorations for extensively damaged endodontically treated
      teeth and to determine which preparation design is most appropriate and which
      materials are best adapted for fabricating endocrowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      literature that was analyzed covered endocrowns from 1995 to June 2018. A search 
      was conducted for in vitro and clinical studies in English in 3 research
      databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus), and this was complemented by a manual
      search in the bibliographies of the studies found. Case reports were excluded.
      RESULTS: A total of 41 publications consisting of 8 clinical studies and 33 in
      vitro studies were included in this systematic review. Several analysis
      parameters were identified: for the clinical studies, survival rate, failure
      modes, and clinical criteria; for the in vitro studies, fracture resistance,
      stress distribution, preparation criteria, and materials used. CONCLUSIONS:
      Endocrowns are a reliable alternative to post-retained restorations for molars
      and seem promising for premolars. A certain preparation design and a rigorous
      adhesion protocol must be respected. Among the available materials, lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic and nanofilled composite resin stand out.

LID - 10.1111/clr.13306 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present systematic review was to analyze the survival 
      and complication rates of zirconia-based and metal-ceramic implant-supported
      single crowns (SCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic MEDLINE search
      complemented by manual searching was conducted to identify randomized controlled 
      clinical trials, prospective cohort and retrospective case series on
      implant-supported SCs with a mean follow-up time of at least 3 years. Patients
      had to have been clinically examined at the follow-up visit. Assessment of the
      identified studies and data extraction was performed independently by two
      reviewers. Failure and complication rates were analyzed using robust Poisson's
      regression models to obtain summary estimates of 5-year proportions. RESULTS: The
      search provided 5,263 titles and 455 abstracts, full-text analysis was performed 
      for 240 articles, resulting in 35 included studies on implant-supported crowns.
      Meta-analysis revealed an estimated 5-year survival rate of 98.3% (95% CI:
      96.8-99.1) for metal-ceramic implant supported SCs (n = 4,363) compared to 97.6% 
      (95% CI: 94.3-99.0) for zirconia implant supported SCs (n = 912). About 86.7%
      (95% CI: 80.7-91.0) of the metal-ceramic SCs (n = 1,300) experienced no
      biological/technical complications over the entire observation period. The
      corresponding rate for zirconia SCs (n = 76) was 83.8% (95% CI: 61.6-93.8). The
      biologic outcomes of the two types of crowns were similar; yet, zirconia SCs
      exhibited less aesthetic complications than metal-ceramics. The 5-year incidence 
      of chipping of the veneering ceramic was similar between the material groups
      (2.9% metal-ceramic, 2.8% zirconia-ceramic). Significantly (p = 0.001), more
      zirconia-ceramic implant SCs failed due to material fractures (2.1% vs. 0.2%
      metal-ceramic implant SCs). No studies on newer types of monolithic zirconia SCs 
      fulfilled the simple inclusion criteria of 3 years follow-up time and clinical
      examination of the present systematic review. CONCLUSION: Zirconia-ceramic
      implant-supported SCs are a valid treatment alternative to metal-ceramic SCs,
      with similar incidence of biological complications and less aesthetic problems.
      The amount of ceramic chipping was similar between the material groups; yet,
      significantly more zirconia crowns failed due to material fractures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present review was to compare the outcomes, that is,
      survival and complication rates of zirconia-ceramic and/or monolithic zirconia
      implant-supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with metal-ceramic FDPs.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic MEDLINE search complemented by manual
      searching was conducted to identify randomized controlled clinical trials,
      prospective cohort studies and retrospective case series on implant-supported
      FDPs with a mean follow-up of at least 3 years. Patients had to have been
      examined clinically at the follow-up visit. Assessment of the identified studies 
      and data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Failure and
      complication rates were analyzed using robust Poisson regression models to obtain
      summary estimates of 5-year proportions. RESULTS: The search provided 5,263
      titles and 455 abstracts. Full-text analysis was performed for 240 articles
      resulting in 19 studies on implant FDPs that met the inclusion criteria. The
      studies reported on 932 metal-ceramic and 175 zirconia-ceramic FDPs.
      Meta-analysis revealed an estimated 5-year survival rate of 98.7% (95% CI:
      96.8%-99.5%) for metal-ceramic implant-supported FDPs, and of 93.0% (95% CI:
      90.6%-94.8%) for zirconia-ceramic implant-supported FDPs (p < 0.001). Thirteen
      studies including 781 metal-ceramic implant-supported FDPs estimated a 5-year
      rate of ceramic fractures and chippings to be 11.6% compared with a significantly
      higher (p < 0.001) complication rate for zirconia implant-supported FDPs of 50%, 
      reported in a small study with 13 zirconia implant-supported FDPs. Significantly 
      (p = 0.001) more, that is, 4.1%, of the zirconia-ceramic implant-supported FDPs
      were lost due to ceramic fractures compared to only 0.2% of the metal-ceramic
      implant-supported FDPs. Detailed analysis of factors like number of units of the 
      FDPs or location in the jaws was not possible due to heterogeneity of reporting. 
      No studies on monolithic zirconia implant-supported FDPs fulfilled the inclusion 
      criteria of the present review. Furthermore, no conclusive results were found for
      the aesthetic outcomes of both FDP-types. CONCLUSION: For implant-supported FDPs,
      conventionally veneered zirconia should not be considered as material selection
      of first priority, as pronounced risk for framework fractures and chipping of the
      zirconia veneering ceramic was observed. Monolithic zirconia may be an
      interesting alternative, but its clinical medium- to long-term outcomes have not 
      been evaluated yet. Hence, metal ceramics seems to stay the golden standard for
      implant-supported multiple-unit FDPs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the survival, failure, and complication rates of veneered
      and monolithic all-ceramic implant-supported single crowns (SCs). METHODS:
      Literature search was conducted in Medline (PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials until September 2020 for randomized, prospective,
      and retrospective clinical trials with follow-up time of at least 1 year,
      evaluating the outcome of veneered and/or monolithic all-ceramic SCs supported by
      titanium dental implants. Survival and complication rates were analyzed using
      robust Poisson's regression models. RESULTS: Forty-nine RCTs and prospective
      studies reporting on 57 material cohorts were included. Meta-analysis of the
      included studies indicated an estimated 3-year survival rate of
      veneered-reinforced glass-ceramic implant-supported SCs of 97.6% (95% CI:
      87.0%-99.6%). The estimated 3-year survival rates were 97.0% (95% CI:
      94.0%-98.5%) for monolithic-reinforced glass-ceramic implant SCs, 96.9% (95% CI: 
      93.4%-98.6%) for veneered densely sintered alumina SCs, 96.3% (95% CI:
      93.9%-97.7%) for veneered zirconia SCs, 96.1% (95% CI: 93.4%-97.8%) for
      monolithic zirconia SCs and only 36.3% (95% CI: 0.04%-87.7%) for
      resin-matrix-ceramic (RMC) SCs. With the exception of RMC SCs (p < 0.0001), the
      differences in survival rates between the materials did not reach statistical
      significance. Veneered SCs showed significantly (p = 0.017) higher annual ceramic
      chipping rates (1.65%) compared with monolithic SCs (0.39%). The location of the 
      SCs, anterior vs. posterior, did not influence survival and chipping rates.
      CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of RMC SCs, veneered and monolithic
      implant-supported ceramic SCs showed favorable short-term survival and
      complication rates. Significantly higher rates for ceramic chipping, however,
      were reported for veneered compared with monolithic ceramic SCs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and patient-reported outcomes of
      bi-layered, all-ceramic posterior single crowns (SCs) supported by zirconia
      implants in an uncontrolled, prospective, multicenter study. METHODS: In two
      centers, 60 patients received 71 one-piece zirconia oral implants to be restored 
      with either SCs (n=49) or three-unit fixed dental prostheses (n=11). Of these
      patients, 45 implants were restored with all-ceramic, zirconia-based posterior
      SCs (one per patient). Survival rates of implants and reconstructions were
      assessed, and technical success was evaluated according to modified U.S. Public
      Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Furthermore, patient-reported outcome measures
      (PROMs) were assessed by applying visual analog scales (VAS). Kaplan-Meier (KM)
      plots and log-rank tests were used for success/survival analyses. The Wilcoxon
      matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to evaluate time effects on response
      variables (PROMs, USPHS criteria). RESULTS: Forty patients with 40 SCs could be
      evaluated after 36.7+/-1.2months. No SC was replaced, resulting in 100% survival.
      The KM success estimate was 87.5% (two chippings, one restoration margin, and one
      contour were rated Charlie). In general, the incidence of chipping (p=.0005) and 
      occlusal roughness (p=.0003) was frequent. Compared with the pre-treatment
      patient surveys (67-93%), all surveys at prosthetic delivery except for speech
      (p=.139) showed significantly improved VAS scores (81-94%; p<.0001). Thereafter, 
      no decrease in satisfaction could be observed over time until the 3-year
      follow-up (86-93%; p>/=.390). CONCLUSION: Veneered, zirconia-based SCs supported 
      by zirconia implants satisfied patients' needs highly. However, significant
      incidence of chipping and roughness of the veneering ceramic may compromise the
      clinical long-term outcome for this indication. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Posterior,
      zirconia-based SCs supported by zirconia oral implants entirely survived the
      follow-up period of 3 years, but two major chippings, one a significant marginal 
      opening and one pronounced over-contouring, resulted in a reduced KM success
      estimate of 87.5% after 36 months of observation.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate failure rates and incidence of chipping for metal-ceramic
      and all-ceramic implant-supported single crowns (SCs). METHODS: Six hundred and
      fifty-two implant-supported SCs placed in 404 patients (mean age: 57.8 years; 193
      male; mean SCs per patient: 1.6) were evaluated up to 12.8 years. The frameworks 
      of the SCs were made from Au alloys (n = 319), CoCr (n = 37), zirconia (n = 286),
      or lithium disilicate (n = 10). Full-coverage ceramic veneers were placed on 319 
      Au SCs, 34 CoCr SCs, and 92 zirconia SCs. One hundred and fifty-two monolithic
      zirconia SCs were not veneered. A partial veneer was placed on the buccal surface
      only of a further 42 zirconia SCs. RESULTS: A total of 26 failures were caused by
      loss of implants (n = 6), ceramic fractures and chipping (n = 15), loosening of
      the abutment (n = 4), or swallowing of a de-cemented SC (n = 1). Kaplan-Meier
      analysis revealed a probability of survival of 96% after five years and 92% after
      10 years. A greater incidence of failure was observed for lithium disilicate and 
      zirconia SCs than for metal-ceramic SCs (p < .05). Separate analysis of the most 
      frequent complication, chipping (n = 61), revealed that zirconia and lithium
      disilicate frameworks were significant risk factors for chipping (p < 0.05).
      Furthermore, a significantly greater incidence of chipping was observed for SCs
      with full-coverage veneers than for monolithic zirconia SCs and for SCs with
      partial veneers (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Avoidance of full-coverage veneers
      significantly improves the clinical performance of implant-supported crowns,
      primarily reduces the incidence of chipping.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the 5-year survival of metal-ceramic and all-ceramic
      tooth-supported single crowns (SCs) and to describe the incidence of biological, 
      technical and esthetic complications. METHODS: Medline (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) searches (2006-2013) were
      performed for clinical studies focusing on tooth-supported fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) with a mean follow-up of at least 3 years. This was
      complimented by an additional hand search and the inclusion of 34 studies from a 
      previous systematic review [1,2]. Survival and complication rates were analyzed
      using robust Poisson's regression models to obtain summary estimates of 5-year
      proportions. RESULTS: Sixty-seven studies reporting on 4663 metal-ceramic and
      9434 all-ceramic SCs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies reported
      on metal-ceramic crowns, and 54 studies reported on all-ceramic crowns.
      Meta-analysis of the included studies indicated an estimated survival rate of
      metal-ceramic SCs of 94.7% (95% CI: 94.1-96.9%) after 5 years. This was similar
      to the estimated 5-year survival rate of leucit or lithium-disilicate reinforced 
      glass ceramic SCs (96.6%; 95% CI: 94.9-96.7%), of glass infiltrated alumina SCs
      (94.6%; 95% CI: 92.7-96%) and densely sintered alumina and zirconia SCs (96%; 95%
      CI: 93.8-97.5%; 92.1%; 95% CI: 82.8-95.6%). In contrast, the 5-year survival
      rates of feldspathic/silica-based ceramic crowns were lower (p<0.001). When the
      outcomes in anterior and posterior regions were compared feldspathic/silica-based
      ceramic and zirconia crowns exhibited significantly lower survival rates in the
      posterior region (p<0.0001), the other crown types performed similarly. Densely
      sintered zirconia SCs were more frequently lost due to veneering ceramic
      fractures than metal-ceramic SCs (p<0.001), and had significantly more loss of
      retention (p<0.001). In total higher 5 year rates of framework fracture were
      reported for the all-ceramic SCs than for metal-ceramic SCs. CONCLUSIONS:
      Survival rates of most types of all-ceramic SCs were similar to those reported
      for metal-ceramic SCs, both in anterior and posterior regions. Weaker
      feldspathic/silica-based ceramics should be limited to applications in the
      anterior region. Zirconia-based SCs should not be considered as primary option
      due to their high incidence of technical problems.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the clinical long-term outcome of
      tooth-supported crowns (SCs), implant-supported crowns (ISCs), and fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) made of a lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic framework material
      (IPS Empress 2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 1999, a total of 184
      restorations (106 SCs, 32 ISCs, 33 FDPs, and 13 diverse restorations) were placed
      in 73 patients. Kaplan-Meier estimation was applied for survival and
      chipping-free rates. Inter-group comparison of both rates was realized by a log
      rank test and a 2x2 contingency table. Also, SCs and FDPs were compared regarding
      adhesive vs. conventional cementation, and anterior vs. posterior positioning,
      for impact on survival. RESULTS: Due to 14 dropouts (34 restorations) and
      reasonable exclusion of 19 other restorations, the final dataset included: i) 87 
      SCs [37 patients, mean observation time 11.4 (+/-3.8)years]; ii) 17 ISCs [12
      patients, mean observation time 13.3 (+/-2.3)years; and iii) 27 FDPs [19
      patients, mean observation time 8.9 (+/-5.4)years]. The 10-year survival
      rate/chipping-free rate for SCs were 86.1%/83.4%, for ISCs 93.8%/94.1%, and for
      FDPs were 51.9%/90.8%. Both ISCs and SCs had a significantly higher survival than
      FDPs (ISCs vs. FDPs: both tests p=0.001; SCs vs. FDPs: p=0.001 and p=0.005).
      Differences in the chipping-free rates did not reach significance. Also, neither 
      the cementation mode nor positioning of the restoration had an impact on
      survival. CONCLUSIONS: SCs had a slightly lower outcome than can generally be
      expected from single crowns. In contrast, ICSs had a favorable outcome and the
      FDPs predominantly failed. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The practitioner's choice of
      dental materials is based (at best) on long-term experience. The present 10-year 
      results are based on comprehensive data analyses and show the high potential of
      lithium-disilicate as a reliable material, especially for single-unit
      restoration.

TI  - Metal-free materials for fixed prosthodontic restorations.
PG  - CD009606
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009606.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fixed prosthodontic treatment (crowns, fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs), complete arch prostheses) involves the use of several different materials
      to replace missing tooth structure. Traditionally full metal or metal frameworks 
      veneered with ceramic (metal-ceramic (MC)) have been used. In recent years
      several different metal-free systems have become available to clinicians and
      patients. In general, metal-free restorations should allow practitioners to
      better reproduce natural tooth colour, avoiding shortcomings of MC restorations. 
      The comparative in service clinical performance of fixed prosthodontic treatments
      of different materials is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of
      metal-free materials for prosthodontic restorations compared to metal-ceramic or 
      other conventional all-metal materials. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Oral Health's
      Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's
      Trials Register (searched 3 May 2017), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
      Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library (searched 3 May 2017),
      MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 3 May 2017), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 3 May 2017). The US
      National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World 
      Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched
      for ongoing trials (searched 3 May 2017). No restrictions were placed on the
      language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which the clinical
      performance of metal-free fixed prosthodontic restorations was compared with
      metal-ceramic (MC) or other conventional restorations in adult patients requiring
      prosthodontic treatment. RCTs in which the clinical performance of different
      kinds of metal-free systems were compared among themselves were also considered. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected
      by Cochrane. Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological
      quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted independently and in
      duplicate. Trial authors were contacted for missing information. Available
      results for the outcomes of interest of the systematic review of the studies
      included were tabulated as they could not be included in a formal meta-analysis. 
      MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials involving a total of 448 participants were included. We
      judged two trials to be at unclear risk of bias and seven to be at high risk of
      bias. The majority of items of risk of bias were evaluated to be at unclear or
      high risk level in more than 50% of the included trials. Each trial except two
      was addressing a different type of intervention. All evidence was rated as being 
      of very low quality due to problems with risk of bias and imprecision of results,
      the latter being due to very small sample sizes, low event rates, 95% confidence 
      intervals including the possibility of benefit for both the test and control
      groups, or combinations of these problems. This means that we are very uncertain 
      about all of the results presented in this review.One trial compared metal-free
      single crowns (full contour zirconia) to cast gold single crowns in 224
      participants and found insufficient evidence of a difference in failure rate
      after one year, but after five years there was some evidence of a benefit for the
      gold crowns. There was insufficient evidence of a difference for crown
      complications at either time of assessment.One trial compared three-unit
      metal-free FDPs (lithium disilicate) to three-unit metal-ceramic FDPs in 37
      participants. There was insufficient evidence of a difference in bridge failure
      at one and six years, but some evidence of a benefit for the lithium disilicate
      group in terms of bridge complications at six years. One trial compared
      zirconia-ceramic FDPs to metal-ceramic FDPs in 34 participants but found
      insufficient evidence of a difference in bridge failures (i.e. no failures in
      either treatment group), bridge complications or patients' aesthetic evaluation
      at any time of assessment up to three years.One trial compared metal-free
      cantilevered FDPs to metal-ceramic cantilevered FDPs in 21 participants. There
      was insufficient evidence of a difference for any primary outcome: bridge
      failures (i.e. no failures in either treatment group), bridge complications, or
      patients' aesthetic evaluation at any time of assessment up to three years.One
      trial compared metal-free implant-supported screw retained single crowns
      (zirconia veneered with feldspathic ceramic) to metal-ceramic implant-supported
      screw-retained single crowns in 20 participants. There was insufficient evidence 
      of a difference for any primary outcome: crown failures (i.e. no failures in
      either treatment group), crown complications, or satisfaction/aesthetic
      evaluation at any time of assessment up to two years.Two trials compared
      metal-free implant abutments (zirconia) to metal implant abutments both
      supporting single crowns in 50 participants. There was insufficient evidence of a
      difference in abutment failure at one year.One trial compared metal-free
      implant-supported FDPs made of two different types of zirconia ceramic in 18
      participants. There was insufficient evidence of a difference in failures at any 
      time of assessment up to 10 years (i.e. no failures in either treatment group).
      There was some evidence of a benefit for the zirconia-toughened alumina group in 
      terms of complications (chipping).One trial compared metal-free tooth-supported
      FDPs made with two different veneering techniques (pressed versus layered) in 40 
      participants. There was insufficient evidence of a difference for failures (i.e. 
      no failures in either treatment group) or complications at any time of assessment
      up to three years. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to
      support or refute the effectiveness of metal-free materials for fixed
      prosthodontic treatment over metal-ceramic or other type of standard
      restorations. The overall quality of existing evidence was very low, therefore
      great caution should be exercised when generalising the results of the included
      trials. Until more evidence becomes available clinicians should continue to base 
      decisions on which material to use for fixed prosthodontic treatment on their own
      clinical experience, whilst taking into consideration the individual
      circumstances and preferences of their patients. There is urgent need of properly
      designed RCTs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Working Group 2 was convened to address topics relevant to
      prosthodontics and dental implants. Systematic reviews were developed according
      to focused questions addressing (a) the number of implants required to support
      fixed full-arch restorations, (b) the influence of intentionally tilted implants 
      compared to axial positioned implants when supporting fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs), (c) implant placement and loading protocols, (d) zirconia dental
      implants, (e) zirconia and metal ceramic implant supported single crowns and (f) 
      zirconia and metal ceramic implant supported FDPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Group 2
      considered and discussed information gathered in six systematic reviews. Group
      participants discussed statements developed by the authors and developed
      consensus. The group developed and found consensus for clinical recommendations
      based on both the statements and the experience of the group. The consensus
      statements and clinical recommendations were presented to the plenary (gathering 
      of all conference attendees) and discussed. Final versions were developed after
      consensus was reached. RESULTS: A total of 27 consensus statements were developed
      from the systematic reviews. Additionally, the group developed 24 clinical
      recommendations based on the combined expertise of the participants and the
      developed consensus statements. CONCLUSIONS: The literature supports the use of
      various implant numbers to support full-arch fixed prostheses. The use of
      intentionally tilted dental implants is indicated when appropriate conditions
      exist. Implant placement and loading protocols should be considered together when
      planning and treating patients. One-piece zirconia dental implants can be
      recommended when appropriate clinical conditions exist although two-piece
      zirconia implants should be used with caution as a result of insufficient data.
      Clinical performance of zirconia and metal ceramic single implant supported
      crowns is similar and each demonstrates significant, though different,
      complications. Zirconia ceramic FDPs are less reliable than metal ceramic.
      Implant supported monolithic zirconia prostheses may be a future option with more
      supporting evidence.

TI  - Evaluation of Zirconia-Based All-Ceramic Single Crowns and Fixed Dental
      Prosthesis on Zirconia Implants: 5-Year Results of a Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 1014-28
LID - 10.1111/cid.12203 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 5-year cohort investigation was to determine the
      survival and success rate of all-ceramic reconstructions on zirconia oral
      implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients received 122 one-piece
      zirconia implants. One hundred seventeen implants were restored with 63 single
      crowns (SCs) and 27 three-unit bridges (fixed dental prostheses, FDPs) fabricated
      using zirconia frameworks (Procera((R)) Zirconia, Nobel Biocare((R)), Goteborg,
      Sweden) hand-layered with a silicate ceramic (NobelRondo() Zirconia, Nobel
      Biocare((R))). With any occurrence of chipping regarded as an event, Kaplan-Meier
      success curves were plotted. Covariates (gender, location, manufacturing date)
      were estimated by the use of log-rank tests. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients
      received prosthetic reconstructions. Sixty-three of them were seen at the 5-year 
      follow-up, with a mean observation time of 58.2 months (47 patients with SCs, 16 
      patients with FDPs). Reasons for the decreasing number of patients at the
      follow-up sessions included dropouts due to implant loss (n = 21), moving (n =
      3), missed appointments (n = 1), and severe illness (n = 1). Over half of the SCs
      (57.2%) and 38% of the FDPs were successful after an observation time of 5 years 
      (overall success rate of 51.7%). The performed log-rank tests revealed no
      statistically significant differences for the success curves regarding the
      above-mentioned covariates. Among the 63 restorations that completed the study,
      11 of 47 SCs and one of 16 FDPs had to be replaced due to the severity of the
      observed chipping. This results in survival rates of 76.6% for the SCs and 93.8% 
      for the FDPs. No framework fractures or decementations were observed in any
      group. CONCLUSION: Hand-layering of zirconia-based SCs and FDPs with NobelRondo()
      Zirconia restoring one-piece zirconia implants did not show acceptable survival
      and success rates. Meanwhile, the material has been recalled from the market. It 
      is advised that new materials should undergo adequate preclinical evaluation
      before coming to the market.

TI  - Long-term chipping and failure rates of implant-supported and combined
      tooth-implant-supported metal-ceramic and ceramic fixed dental prostheses: A
      cohort study.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Combined tooth-implant-supported fixed dental prostheses
      have been associated with an increased risk of long-term failure. Furthermore,
      high chipping rates have been reported for ceramic fixed dental prostheses.
      However, clinical data are sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this observational
      cohort study was to evaluate the chipping and failure rates of metal-ceramic and 
      ceramic implant-supported and combined tooth-implant-supported fixed dental
      prostheses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four hundred thirty-four fixed dental
      prostheses placed in 324 patients (mean age: 60.8 years) were selected from a
      prospective clinical long-term study comprising 213 implant-supported fixed
      dental prostheses, 66 implant-supported cantilever fixed dental prostheses, and
      155 tooth-implant-supported fixed dental prostheses. Metal-ceramic fixed dental
      prostheses (n=260) were fabricated with a high noble metal alloy (n=225) or Co-Cr
      base metal alloy (n=35) frameworks. Ceramic fixed dental prostheses (n=174) were 
      all zirconia based and had monolithic (n=68), completely veneered (n=43), or
      partially veneered frameworks (n=63). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate
      the survival probability and the chipping-free survival rate of the fixed dental 
      prostheses. RESULTS: During the observation period of 0.5 to 12.6 years (mean:
      4.26 years), 17 fixed dental prostheses failed because of implant failure (n=6), 
      tooth loss (n=5), major chipping (n=5), or abutment screw loosening (n=1).
      Survival probability was 96% after 5 years and 91% after 10 years. Cox regression
      analysis showed that age, sex, fixed dental prosthesis location, type of fixed
      dental prosthesis support, and fixed dental prosthesis material had no
      significant effect on fixed dental prosthesis failure. Chipping (n=61) was
      significantly affected by the framework material and type of veneer (P=.001).
      After 5 years, the greatest incidence of chipping (39%) was observed for zirconia
      fixed dental prostheses with a complete veneer compared with an 18% incidence of 
      chipping for metal-ceramic fixed dental prostheses with a high noble metal
      framework. A lower incidence of chipping was observed for zirconia fixed dental
      prostheses with a partial veneer or monolithic design. CONCLUSIONS:
      Implant-implant-supported and combined tooth-implant-supported fixed dental
      prostheses have promising long-term survival rates. Chipping seems to occur less 
      frequently in monolithic or partially veneered fixed dental prostheses than in
      fixed dental prostheses with complete veneers.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of partial and full-arch all-ceramic implant-supported fixed
      dental prostheses. A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 224-236
LID - 10.1111/clr.13345 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the survival and technical complication rate of partial and 
      full-arch all-ceramic implant-supported fixed dental prostheses (P-FDP/FA-FDP)
      and supporting implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search through
      three databases (MEDLINE/Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase) was conducted to
      identify relevant clinical studies with an observation period of at least 12
      months, including >/=15 patients. Reconstruction and implant survival rates,
      technical complications and confounding variables such as processed/installed
      materials, retention mode and location in the mouth were obtained. Failure and
      complication rates were analyzed using standard Poisson regression models to
      calculate 5-year survival and complication estimates. RESULTS: A total of five
      studies for the P-FDP group and seven studies for the FA-FDP group were included,
      throughout evaluating veneered zirconia reconstructions. In the P-FDP group,
      reconstructions were located in posterior regions. Meta-analysis indicated
      survival estimates on the reconstruction level of 98.3% and 97.7% for P- and
      FA-FDPs after 5 years. However, chipping of the veneering ceramic was frequent,
      resulting in estimated 5-year complication rates of 22.8% (P-FDPs) and 34.8%
      (FA-FDPs). Five-year survival estimates of implants supporting P-FDPs and FA-FDPs
      of 98.5% and 99.4% were calculated, respectively. Including a total of 540 FDPs, 
      one screw-loosening and 11 de-cementations were reported. Confounding variables
      were not found to have a significant influence on survival and complication
      rates. CONCLUSIONS: All-ceramic implant-supported P- and FA-FDPs comprising
      veneered zirconia frameworks showed high survival but clinically inacceptable
      fracture rates of the veneering ceramic. Their suitability with regard to this
      indication and a successful long-term outcome needs to be further evaluated.

TI  - Clinical Results and Technical Complications of Posterior Implant-Supported
      Modified Monolithic Zirconia Single Crowns and Short-Span Fixed Dental
      Prostheses: A 2-Year Pilot Study.
PG  - 108-114
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12682 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical trial was to investigate the clinical
      outcomes of implant-supported modified monolithic zirconia single crowns (SCs)
      and short-span fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) after a follow-up of 2 years.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients in need of implant-supported SCs or 
      3-unit FDPs in the posterior maxilla or mandible were consecutively selected for 
      this study. A total of 56 modified monolithic zirconia prostheses including 44
      SCs (8 screw-retained, 36 cement-retained) and twelve 3-unit FDPs (5
      screw-retained, 7 cement-retained) were included in this study. All patients were
      followed at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 2 years after placement of the
      modified monolithic zirconia prostheses. During the follow-up period, all
      prostheses were evaluated with clinical and radiographic examinations. The
      following technical parameters were assessed: framework fracture, fracture of
      veneering porcelain, screw loosening, loss of retention because of prosthesis
      de-cementation and opposing tooth fracture. RESULTS: No implant was lost during
      the follow-up period, yielding a 2-year implant survival of 100%. One FDP failed 
      because of framework fracture. The overall prosthesis survival rate was 98.2%
      after 2 years of clinical service. During the study, 5 complication events were
      observed in 3 SCs and one FDP, including one fracture of veneering porcelain and 
      2 screw loosenings in 3 SCs, and loss of retention and opposing tooth fracture in
      the same FDP. Therefore, the complication-free rate of prostheses was 91.1%.
      CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, the modified monolithic
      zirconia design used in this study resulted in a favorable short-term outcome for
      posterior implant-supported SCs and 3-unit FDPs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this clinical study was to evaluate survival and
      incidence of complications for metal-ceramic and all-ceramic implant-supported
      fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) and tooth-implant-supported FDPs. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: One-hundred and sixty-six FDPs placed in 132 patients from a prospective
      study were selected for this retrospective analysis. Included were 91
      conventional implant-supported FDPs with implant support on both extremities, 27 
      implant-supported cantilever FDPs, and 48 tooth-implant-supported FDPs. All
      restorations were veneered with ceramic. Twenty-six FDPs had a zirconia framework
      and 140 had a metal framework. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate
      FDP success defined as complication-free survival and the Cox regression model
      was used to isolate risk factors for the most frequent complications. RESULTS:
      Within a median follow-up of 1 year and 2 months, three failures were caused by a
      failed implant (n = 2) and by extended chipping of the veneer (n = 1). In
      contrast with this low incidence of failure was a high incidence of complications
      including chipping (n = 29), loss of retention (n = 35), and abutment fractures
      (n = 2). Multivariate survival analysis revealed a significantly greater
      incidence of chipping for males and a tendency to increased incidence of chipping
      for zirconia-based FDPs. The incidence of loss of retention tended to be less for
      tooth-implant-supported FDPs, for which semi-permanent cement was the only
      significant risk factor, with a hazard ratio of almost 5. CONCLUSIONS: As
      chipping of the ceramic veneer was the most frequent complication leading to
      substantial aftercare, improvements of ceramic veneers are desirable for
      zirconia-based and metal-based FDPs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The implant-supported restorations can be made of all-ceramic
      materials. The purpose of this study was to compare five year clinical outcomes
      of zirconia-based and metal ceramic implant-supported fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs). METHODS: In this study, 114 posterior implant-supported FDPs including
      zirconia-based (52) or metal ceramic (62) restorations were made for 114 patients
      with a mean age of 59+/-8.4years and evaluated in a 5year follow up. The modified
      California Dental Association (CDA) guidelines were used to assess the quality of
      the restorations. The soft tissue status was evaluated using gingival and plaque 
      indices, probing depth and bleeding on probing. Additionally, the bone loss
      around implants was assessed by parallel priapical radiographs. The visual
      analogue scale was used regarding patients' satisfaction. The data analysis were 
      performed by Kaplan-Meier, log rank test, Cox regression, Mann-Whitney U and
      Student's t-test. (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Five year Kaplan-Meier survival rate of 
      the zirconia-based and metal ceramic FDPs were 98.1 % and 100 % respectively with
      no significant difference (P=0.12). The success rates were 81.6 % for
      zirconia-based and 81.0 % for metal ceramic restorations (P=0.85). The CDA rating
      of both studied groups was not significantly different except the marginal gap
      which was better in zirconia-based FDPs (P<0.001). Fracture of veneering ceramics
      occurred in 2.7 % of metal ceramic and 6.4 % of zirconia-based FDPs, which were
      not considered as failure. Soft tissue status was not affected by the type of
      restorations except for plaque index which was more favorable for zirconia-based 
      FDPs (P<0.001). No significant difference was found between marginal bone loss of
      the two groups (P=0.30 mesial, P=0.46 distal). CONCLUSIONS: Zirconia-based and
      metal ceramic FDPs showed similar promising clinical performance in the 5-year
      follow-up. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Zirconia-based implant-supported FDPs might be 
      a successful restorative method with acceptable survival rate and patient's
      satisfaction.

TI  - The clinical performance of all-ceramic implant-supported single crowns: A
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 196-223
LID - 10.1111/clr.13337 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This review aimed at evaluating the survival and technical
      complication rates of all-ceramic implant-supported single crowns (SC). MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: Three electronic databases were searched for clinical studies
      conducted at >/= 15 patients examining implant-supported all-ceramic SCs over >/=
      12 months. Survival rates of implants and restorations plus technical
      complication rates of SCs were calculated and tested for statistical correlation 
      with confounding variables. Statistical analysis was performed using a negative
      binomial distribution model to calculate 5- and 10-year survival and complication
      estimates. RESULTS: Forty-one included studies reported on implant-supported SCs 
      made of veneered and monolithic high-strength oxide ceramics, monolithic, and
      veneered glass-based ceramics and of a monolithic resin-nano-ceramic (RNC).
      Survival estimates for SCs of 93% (95% CI: 86.6%-96.4%) after 5 years and 94.4%
      (95% CI: 91.1%-96.5%) after 10 years were calculated, corresponding values for
      implant survival were 95.3% (95% CI: 90.6%-97.7%) and 96.2% (95% CI:
      95.1%-97.1%). Technical complication rates after 5/10 years were as follows:
      chipping 9.0% (95% CI: 5.4%-14.8%)/2.7% (95% CI: 2.1%-3.5%), framework fractures 
      1.9% (95% CI: 0.7%-4.9%)/1.2% (95% CI: 1%-1.5%), screw loosening 3.6% (95% CI:
      1.6%-8.4%)/5.2% (95% CI: 3.6%-7.5%), and decementations with 1.1% (95% CI:
      0.4%-2.8%) after 5 years. Some confounding variables influenced the
      above-mentioned estimates significantly. CONCLUSIONS: All-ceramic
      implant-supported SCs showed-with the exception of a RNC material-high survival
      rates. However, failures and technical complications occurred which have to be
      considered when informing patients on the treatment with implant-supported
      all-ceramic SCs.

TI  - Comparison of survival and complication rates of tooth-supported fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) and implant-supported FDPs and single crowns (SCs).
PG  - 97-113
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess and compare the
      5- and 10-year survival of different types of tooth-supported and
      implant-supported fixed dental prosthesis (FDPs) and single crowns (SCs) and to
      describe the incidence of biological and technical complications. METHODS: Three 
      electronic searches complemented by manual searching were conducted to identify
      prospective and retrospective cohort studies on FDPs and SCs with a mean
      follow-up time of at least 5 years. Patients had to have been examined clinically
      at the follow-up visit. Failure and complication rates were analyzed using
      random-effects Poisson's regression models to obtain summary estimates of 5- and 
      10-year survival proportions. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the included studies
      indicated an estimated 5-year survival of conventional tooth-supported FDPs of
      93.8%, cantilever FDPs of 91.4%, solely implant-supported FDPs of 95.2%, combined
      tooth-implant-supported FDPs of 95.5% and implant-supported SCs of 94.5%.
      Moreover, after 10 years of function the estimated survival decreased to 89.2%
      for conventional FDPs, to 80.3% for cantilever FDPs, to 86.7% for
      implant-supported FDPs, to 77.8% for combined tooth-implant-supported FDPs and to
      89.4% for implant-supported SCs. Despite high survival rates, 38.7% the patients 
      with implant-supported FDPs had some complications after the 5-year observation
      period. This is compared with 15.7% for conventional FDPs and 20.6% for
      cantilever FDPs, respectively. For conventional tooth-supported FDPs, the most
      frequent complications were biological complications like caries and loss of pulp
      vitality. Compared with tooth-supported FDPs, the incidence of technical
      complications was significantly higher for the implant-supported reconstructions.
      The most frequent technical complications were fractures of the veneer material
      (ceramic fractures or chipping), abutment or screw loosening and loss of
      retention. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the results of the present systematic
      review, planning of prosthetic rehabilitations should preferentially include
      conventional end abutment tooth-supported FDPs, solely implant-supported FDPs or 
      implant-supported SCs. Only for reasons of anatomical structures or
      patient-centered preferences and as a second option should cantilever
      tooth-supported FDPs or FDPs supported by combination of implants and teeth be
      chosen.

TI  - Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial to Compare Posterior Implant-Supported
      Modified Monolithic Zirconia and Metal-Ceramic Single Crowns: One-Year Results.
PG  - 15-21
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12767 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to
      investigate the prosthetic outcomes of posterior implant-supported single crowns 
      (SCs) with a modified monolithic zirconia or metal-ceramic design at 1 year of
      loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty participants with 73 dental implants in
      need of at least 1 maxillary or mandibular posterior implant-supported SC were
      consecutively selected for this study. The included participants were randomly
      divided into modified monolithic zirconia (MMZ) and metal-ceramic (MC) groups.
      The implant-supported SCs were examined after 1 year for survival and technical
      complications. Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate the data, and the
      association associated risks of complications were estimated using the logistic
      regression model with Firth's approach for rare outcome (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: 
      During the observation period, 2 participants in the MC group were lost to
      follow-up. A total of 38 participants with 70 posterior implant-supported SCs (36
      and 34 SCs in the MMZ and MC groups respectively) completed the 1-year follow-up 
      examination. One implant failed in the MMZ group. The 1-year survival rates for
      implants and crowns were both 97.2% in the MMZ group. The survival rates for
      implants and crowns were both 100% in the MC group. One screw loosening event was
      observed in one screw-retained SC in the MMZ group; however, 8 complication
      events occurred in 7 SCs in the MC group. Therefore, the complication-free rates 
      were 97.1% and 79.4% in the MMZ and MC SCs respectively. The most common
      complication in the MC group was screw loosening (14.7%), followed by loss of
      retention (5.9%), and ceramic fracture (2.9%). Significantly more technical
      complications were observed in the MC SCs than MMZ SCs (p = 0.0432). CONCLUSION: 
      The modified monolithic zirconia design applied to the posterior
      implant-supported SCs had a significantly lower technical complication rate than 
      did the metal-ceramic one.

TI  - Rehabilitation of edentulous jaws with zirconia complete-arch fixed
      implant-supported prostheses: An up to 4-year retrospective clinical study.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Limited data are available on the clinical outcomes of
      patients with edentulism treated with zirconia complete-arch fixed
      implant-supported prostheses (CAFIPs). PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this
      retrospective clinical study was to study the failure rate of dental implants as 
      well as the fracture rate of zirconia CAFIPs. The secondary purpose was to study 
      the survival outcomes of patients with edentulism treated with zirconia CAFIPs as
      well as the rate of technical complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This
      retrospective clinical study from private practice included 128 patients
      rehabilitated between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016, with 1072 implants 
      supporting 191 zirconia CAFIPs for single-jaw as well as double-jaw
      rehabilitations. All zirconia prostheses were of 1-piece design and were veneered
      with feldspathic porcelain only at the gingival region and therefore considered
      as predominantly monolithic. Additionally, all prostheses were bonded to implant 
      manufacturer's titanium cylinders that provided an intimate contact with the
      implants. The primary outcome measures were implant failure rate and prosthesis
      fracture rate. The secondary outcome measures were prosthodontic treatment
      survival rate and the incidence of technical complications with respect to
      monolithic zirconia CAFIPs. Cumulative survival rate (CSR) for implants and
      prostheses was calculated after a life-table survival analysis. RESULTS: Of the
      analyzed samples over a 4-year period, at least 288 implants and 49 prostheses
      had a minimum of 4 years of follow-up. A total of 18 implant failures were noted 
      (13 in maxilla, 5 in mandible), yielding a CSR of 97.6% for implants. One
      fracture of the zirconia prosthesis was recorded, yielding a CSR of 99.4% for the
      prostheses over the 4-year period. Another 3 prostheses required remaking because
      the supporting implants failed, and 1 prosthesis was remade because the lack of
      passive fit resulted in a CSR of 96.8% for the prosthodontic treatment itself.
      During the 4-year period, 1 zirconia prosthesis had a technical complication
      related to the debonding of titanium cylinders, and 2 prostheses had fractured
      screws, which were resolved successfully. No zirconia prostheses had chipping of 
      the veneered gingival porcelain. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this retrospective
      clinical study from private practice showed that prosthodontic treatment of
      edentulous patients with a 1-piece, complete-arch fixed implant-supported
      zirconia prosthesis with veneered porcelain restricted to the gingival region had
      high survival rates for implants and prostheses. Minimal technical complications 
      related to this type of treatment for edentulous jaws and no chipping of the
      veneered gingival porcelain were encountered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is yet available on zirconia-based prostheses
      supported by implants. PURPOSE: To evaluate technical problems and failures of
      implant-supported zirconia-based prostheses with exclusive screw-retention.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients received screw-retained zirconia-based
      prostheses supported by implants and were followed over a time period of 5 years.
      The implant placement and prosthetic rehabilitation were performed in one
      clinical setting, and all patients participated in the maintenance program. The
      treatment comprised single crowns (SCs) and fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) of
      three to 12 units. Screw-retention of the CAD/CAM-fabricated SCs and FDPs was
      performed with direct connection at the implant level. The primary outcome was
      the complete failure of zirconia-based prostheses; outcome measures were fracture
      of the framework or extensive chipping resulting in the need for refabrication. A
      life table analysis was performed, the cumulative survival rate (CSR) calculated,
      and a Kaplan-Meier curve drawn. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety-four implants
      supported 156 zirconia-based prostheses in 95 patients (52 men, 43 women, average
      age 59.1 +/- 11.7 years). Sixty-five SCs and 91 FDPs were identified, comprising 
      a total of 441 units. Fractures of the zirconia framework and extensive chipping 
      resulted in refabrication of nine prostheses. Nearly all the prostheses (94.2%)
      remained in situ during the observation period. The 5-year CSR was 90.5%, and 41 
      prostheses (14 SCs, 27 FDPs) comprising 113 units survived for an observation
      time of more than 5 years. Six SCs exhibited screw loosening, and polishing of
      minor chipping was required for five prostheses. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows
      that zirconia-based implant-supported fixed prostheses exhibit satisfactory
      treatment outcomes and that screw-retention directly at the implant level is
      feasible.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess survival/success rates and patient-reported outcome of
      zirconia-based posterior single crowns (SCs) supported by zirconia implants in a 
      prospective two-center study after five years of observation. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Forty-five patients were restored with 45 zirconia implant-supported
      posterior SCs composed of zirconia frameworks hand-layered with a
      leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramic. Survival rates of SCs were assessed and
      technical success was evaluated according to modified United States Public Health
      Care (USPHS) criteria. Furthermore, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)
      were assessed by applying visual analog scales (VAS). Wilcoxon matched-pairs
      signed-rank test, mixed-effects ordered logistic regression, and linear mixed
      models were used to evaluate time effects on response variables. RESULTS: Forty
      patients were available after a mean observation period of 61.0 +/- 1.4 months.
      One SC had to be replaced, resulting in a Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival estimate for
      the SCs of 97.5 +/- 2.47%. Since nine reconstructions showed at least in one
      category a major deviation from the ideal (five major chippings, four with
      increased occlusal roughness, one significant crevice, and one pronounced
      over-contouring), the KM success estimate was 79.3 +/- 5.8%. Incidence of
      chipping (n = 19) and occlusal roughness (n = 35) was frequent (p < 0.001). All
      PROMs at prosthetic delivery except for speech (p = 0.139) showed significantly
      improved VAS scores (81%-94%; p < 0.001) compared to pre-treatment evaluations.
      Thereafter, no decrease in satisfaction could be observed until the 5-year
      follow-up (93%-97%). CONCLUSION: Veneered zirconia-based SCs supported by
      zirconia implants showed high survival rates and highly satisfied patients'
      needs. However, significant incidence of technical complications is compromising 
      the clinical long-term outcome for this indication.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the 5-year survival of metal-ceramic and all-ceramic
      tooth-supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) and to describe the incidence of
      biological, technical and esthetic complications. METHODS: Medline (PubMed),
      Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) searches
      (2006-2013) were performed for clinical studies focusing on tooth-supported FDPs 
      with a mean follow-up of at least 3 years. This was complemented by an additional
      hand search and the inclusion of 10 studies from a previous systematic review
      [1]. Survival and complication rates were analyzed using robust Poisson's
      regression models to obtain summary estimates of 5-year proportions. RESULTS:
      Forty studies reporting on 1796 metal-ceramic and 1110 all-ceramic FDPs fulfilled
      the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the included studies indicated an
      estimated 5-year survival rate of metal-ceramic FDPs of 94.4% (95% CI:
      91.2-96.5%). The estimated survival rate of reinforced glass ceramic FDPs was
      89.1% (95% CI: 80.4-94.0%), the survival rate of glass-infiltrated alumina FDPs
      was 86.2% (95% CI: 69.3-94.2%) and the survival rate of densely sintered zirconia
      FDPs was 90.4% (95% CI: 84.8-94.0%) in 5 years of function. Even though the
      survival rate of all-ceramic FDPs was lower than for metal-ceramic FDPs, the
      differences did not reach statistical significance except for the
      glass-infiltrated alumina FDPs (p=0.05). A significantly higher incidence of
      caries in abutment teeth was observed for densely sintered zirconia FDPs compared
      to metal-ceramic FDPs. Significantly more framework fractures were reported for
      reinforced glass ceramic FDPs (8.0%) and glass-infiltrated alumina FDPs (12.9%)
      compared to metal-ceramic FDPs (0.6%) and densely sintered zirconia FDPs (1.9%)
      in 5 years in function. However, the incidence of ceramic fractures and loss of
      retention was significantly (p=0.018 and 0.028 respectively) higher for densely
      sintered zirconia FDPs compared to all other types of FDPs. CONCLUSIONS: Survival
      rates of all types of all-ceramic FDPs were lower than those reported for
      metal-ceramic FDPs. The incidence of framework fractures was significantly higher
      for reinforced glass ceramic FDPs and infiltrated glass ceramic FDPs, and the
      incidence for ceramic fractures and loss of retention was significantly higher
      for densely sintered zirconia FDPs compared to metal-ceramic FDPs.

TI  - Standardizing failure, success, and survival decisions in clinical studies of
      ceramic and metal-ceramic fixed dental prostheses.
PG  - 102-11
LID - 10.1016/j.dental.2011.09.012 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The recent increase in reports from clinical studies of ceramic
      chipping has raised the question of which criteria should constitute success or
      failure of total-ceramic prostheses. Terminologies such as minor chipping [1],
      partial chipping, technical complications [2,3], and biological complications
      have crept into the dental terminology and they have complicated our
      classification of success and failure of these crown and bridge restorations.
      Some journals have permitted the reporting of fractures as ""complications"" and
      they are not necessarily classified as failures in the study. One study has
      attempted to classify chipping fractures according to their severity and
      subsequent treatment [4]. This is a promising approach to resolve the challenges 
      to the classification of chipping fracture. The term 'chipping fracture' is more 
      descriptive than 'chipping' since the latter term tends to imply an event of
      minor consequence. Two types of statistics are reported routinely in these
      studies, i.e., percent success, which is a measure of restorations that survive
      without any adverse effects, and percent survival, which is a measure of all
      restorations that survive even though they may have exhibited chipping fracture
      or they may have been repaired. Why has this scenario occurred? One possible
      explanation is that many of these types of fractures are very small and do not
      affect function or esthetics. Another reason is that corporate sponsors prefer to
      use the term chipping since it does not connote failure in the sense that the
      term fracture does. In any event, we need to be more precise in our scientific
      observations of fracture and classifications of the various types of fracture
      including details on the location of fracture and the prosthesis design
      configuration. Because of the lack of standardized methods for describing
      chipping fractures, materials scientists are unable to properly analyze the
      effect of material properties and design factors on the time-dependent survival
      probability of ceramic fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). Based on the review of
      clinical trials and systematic reviews of these trials, the present study was
      designed to develop guidelines for classifying the functional performance,
      success, survival, and susceptibility to chipping fracture, and subsequent
      treatment of ceramic and metal-ceramic restorations. OBJECTIVE: To develop
      comprehensive descriptive guidelines and a clinical reporting form to assist
      dental scientists in their analyses of chipping fracture behavior of
      metal-ceramic and all-ceramic prostheses with particular emphasis on
      veneered-zirconia restorations. These guidelines are required to optimize the
      recording of fracture features that can be used to differentiate ceramic chipping
      fracture from bulk fracture and to assist dentists in identifying subsequent
      treatment that may minimize the need to replace affected restorations. A
      recording form for clinical fracture observations must be sufficiently clear and 
      complete so that dental health professionals can translate the most relevant
      information in a context that allows their patients to fully understand the
      potential risks and benefits of treatment with ceramic restorations. It should
      clearly allow a clinician to determine whether or not a ceramic fracture
      constitutes a failure, which requires replacement of the prosthesis, or whether
      the fracture surface is relatively small or located in a nonfunctional area,
      i.e., one that is not contribute to occlusion, esthetics, proximal contacts, or
      food impaction. To accomplish this task, a review of the relevant publications of
      clinical trials was necessary to identify the variability in reporting of
      fracture events. The reviews were focused on clinical research studies of
      zirconia-based FDPs and PFM FDPs, which had been monitored through recall exams
      for three years or more. These reports and systematic reviews of all relevant
      publications were published in English dental journals between 2004 and 2010.The 
      primary focus in this review was on the susceptibility to chipping fracture or
      bulk fracture of veneered zirconia-based fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) and
      metal-ceramic FDPs, which are also referred to in this paper as
      porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) FDPs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In vitro investigation of the effects of fixed dental prosthesis
      (FDP) support and loading conditions on the fracture behavior of all-ceramic,
      zirconia-based FDP veneered with computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-manufactured lithium disilicate ceramic. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Based on a model for a 3-unit FDP in the molar region (tooth in region
      15, implant in region 17), 16 identical zirconia frameworks were fabricated and
      veneered with milled lithium disilicate ceramic. Another 16 FDPs were
      manufactured similarly, using a model in which the tooth was replaced by an
      implant. The specimens underwent 10,000 thermal cycles between 6.5 and 60 degrees
      C and 1,200,000 chewing cycles with a force magnitude of 100 N. All were then
      subsequently loaded until fracture in a universal testing device. Half of the
      FDPs were subjected to centric and axial loading on the pontic, the others to
      eccentric and oblique loading on one cusp of the pontic. RESULTS: No failures
      were observed after artificial aging. Fracture loads of tooth-implant-supported
      restorations were 1636 +/- 158 and 1086 +/- 156 N for axial and oblique loading, 
      respectively; implant-supported FDPs fractured at 1789 +/- 202 and 1200 +/- 68 N,
      respectively. Differences were significant for load application (P < 0.001) and
      support type (P = 0.020). For the two types of load application, fracture mode
      differed substantially: complete fracture was observed for centric and axial
      loading whereas mixed cohesive/adhesive failure was observed for many FDPs loaded
      eccentrically and obliquely. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of chipping of
      manually veneered implant-supported all-ceramics restorations might be reduced by
      use of CAD/CAM-manufactured lithium disilicate veneers. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: FDPs 
      veneered with lithium disilicate resist occlusal forces of 500 N, irrespective of
      load application and support type. The fracture resistance of implant-supported
      FDPs was, however, higher than that of combined tooth-implant-supported FDPs.
      Their clinical use seems to be justified.

AB  - The aim was to make an inventory of the current literature on the clinical
      performance of tooth- or implant-supported zirconia-based FDPs and analyse and
      discuss any complications. Electronic databases, PubMed.gov, Cochrane Library and
      Science Direct, were searched for original studies reporting on the clinical
      performance of tooth- or implant-supported zirconia-based FDPs. The electronic
      search was complemented by manual searches of the bibliographies of all retrieved
      full-text articles and reviews, as well as a hand search of the following
      journals: International Journal of Prosthodontics, Journal of Oral
      Rehabilitation, International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Implants and
      Clinical Oral Implants Research. The search yielded 4253 titles. Sixty-eight
      potentially relevant full-text articles were retrieved. After applying
      pre-established criteria, 27 studies were included. Twenty-three studies reported
      on tooth-supported and 4 on implant-supported FDPs. Five of the studies were
      randomised, comparing Y-TZP-based restorations with metal-ceramic or other
      all-ceramic restorations. Most tooth-supported FDPs were FDPs of 3-5 units,
      whereas most implant-supported FDPs were full arch. The majority of the studies
      reported on 3- to 5-year follow-up. Life table analysis revealed cumulative
      5-year survival rates of 93.5% for tooth-supported and 100% for implant-supported
      FDPs. For tooth-supported FDPs, the most common reasons for failure were
      veneering material fractures, framework fractures and caries. Cumulative 5-year
      complication rates were 27.6% and 30.5% for tooth- and implant-supported FDPs,
      respectively. The most common complications were veneering material fractures for
      tooth- as well as implant-supported FDPs. Loss of retention occurred more
      frequently in FDPs luted with zinc phosphate or glass-ionomer cement compared to 
      those luted with resin cements. The results suggest that the 5-year survival rate
      is excellent for implant-supported zirconia-based FDPs, despite the incidence of 
      complications, and acceptable for tooth-supported zirconia-based FDPs. These
      results are, however, based on a relatively small number of studies, especially
      for the implant-supported FDPs. The vast majority of the studies are not
      controlled clinical trials and have limited follow-up. Thus, interpretation of
      the results should be made with caution. Well-designed studies with large patient
      groups and long follow-up times are needed before general recommendations for the
      use of zirconia-based restorations can be provided.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the survival outcomes and reported complications of screw- and
      cement-retained fixed reconstructions supported on dental implants. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A Medline (PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane electronic database search from
      2000 to September 2012 using MeSH and free-text terms was conducted. Selected
      inclusion and exclusion criteria guided the search. All studies were first
      reviewed by abstract and subsequently by full-text reading by two examiners
      independently. Data were extracted by two examiners and statistically analyzed
      using a random effects Poisson regression. RESULTS: From 4,324 abstracts, 321
      full-text articles were reviewed. Seventy-three articles were found to qualify
      for inclusion. Five-year survival rates of 96.03% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      93.85% to 97.43%) and 95.55% (95% CI: 92.96% to 97.19%) were calculated for
      cemented and screw-retained reconstructions, respectively (P = .69). Comparison
      of cement and screw retention showed no difference when grouped as single crowns 
      (I-SC) (P = .10) or fixed partial dentures (I-FDP) (P = .49). The 5-year survival
      rate for screw-retained full-arch reconstructions was 96.71% (95% CI: 93.66% to
      98.31). All-ceramic reconstruction material exhibited a significantly higher
      failure rate than porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) in cemented reconstructions (P =
      .01) but not when comparing screw-retained reconstructions (P = .66). Technical
      and biologic complications demonstrating a statistically significant difference
      included loss of retention (P </= .01), abutment loosening (P </= .01), porcelain
      fracture and/or chipping (P = .02), presence of fistula/suppuration (P </= .001),
      total technical events (P = .03), and total biologic events (P = .02).
      CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistical difference was found between cement- and
      screw-retained reconstructions for survival or failure rates, screw-retained
      reconstructions exhibited fewer technical and biologic complications overall.
      There were no statistically significant differences between the failure rates of 
      the different reconstruction types (I-SCs, I-FDPs, full-arch I-FDPs) or abutment 
      materials (titanium, gold, ceramic). The failure rate of cemented reconstructions
      was not influenced by the choice of a specific cement, though cement type did
      influence loss of retention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the influence
      of implant-abutment connection and abutment material on the outcome of
      implant-supported single crowns (SCs) and fixed dental prostheses (FDPs).
      METHODS: An electronic Medline search complemented by manual searching was
      conducted to identify randomized controlled clinical trials, prospective and
      retrospective studies with a mean follow-up time of at least 3 years. Patients
      had to have been examined clinically at the follow-up visit. Failure and
      complication rates were analyzed using robust Poisson regression, and comparisons
      were made with multivariable Poisson regression models. RESULTS: The search
      provided 1511 titles and 177 abstracts. Full-text analysis was performed for 147 
      articles resulting in 60 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of
      these studies indicated an estimated 5-year survival rate of 97.6% for SCs and
      97.0% for FDPs supported by implants with internal implant-abutment connection
      and 95.7% for SCs and 95.8% for FDPs supported by implants with external
      connection. The 5-year abutment failure rate ranged from 0.7% to 2.8% for
      different connections with no differences between the types of connections. The
      total number of complications was similar between the two connections, yet, at
      external connections, abutment or occlusal screw loosening was more predominant. 
      Ceramic abutments, both internally and externally connected, demonstrated a
      significantly higher incidence of abutment fractures compared with metal
      abutments. CONCLUSION: For implant-supported SCs, both metal and ceramic
      abutments with internal and external connections exhibited high survival rates.
      Moreover, implant-supported FDPs with metal abutments with internal and external 
      connections for also showed high survival rates.

TI  - Zirconia implants restored with single crowns or fixed dental prostheses: 5-year 
      results of a prospective cohort investigation.
PG  - 452-462
LID - 10.1111/clr.13581 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of one-piece zirconia
      implants restored with single crowns (SCs) or fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) over
      an observation period of 5 years in function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a
      prospective cohort investigation with two investigational centers, one-piece
      zirconia implants were placed in anterior and posterior sites. After a healing
      period of at least 2 months in the mandible and 4 months in the maxilla with
      immediate provisional reconstructions, the final all-ceramic SCs or three-unit
      FDPs were cemented. Patients were followed for 5 years. Clinical parameters and
      radiological measurements of the implants and the neighboring teeth were
      assessed. For the statistical analysis, linear mixed models were applied.
      RESULTS: A total of 71 implants were placed in 60 patients. Sixty-three implants 
      in 53 patients could be evaluated at the 5-year follow-up. Six patients with a
      total of seven implants were counted as dropouts. One implant did not achieve
      adequate osseointegration and had to be removed 5 weeks after implantation. The
      5-year survival rate was calculated as 98.4% (95% CI 91.6, 99.9). The mean
      overall marginal bone loss from implant placement to the 5-year follow-up was 0.7
      +/- 0.6 mm. After an initial mean marginal loss before loading the implants (0.7 
      mm), no further statistically significant change in marginal bone level (p =
      .458) could be observed. CONCLUSION: The investigated one-piece zirconia implant 
      showed a high survival rate, very stable marginal bone, and mucosal margin levels
      after 5 years in function. Therefore, it can be considered safe and reliable for 
      the reconstruction of implant-supported SCs or FDPs over a mid-term period.

AB  - This study compared the fracture resistance of monolithic and veneered
      all-ceramic four-unit posterior fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) generated by
      computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) after aging in a
      mastication simulator. Four-unit FDPs were designed from six different
      all-ceramic systems: 1) monolithic lithium disilicate (M-E), 2) monolithic
      zirconia (M-TZI), 3) veneered zirconia by conventional layering (V-L), 4)
      veneered zirconia by lithium disilicate pressing (V-P), 5) veneered zirconia by
      lithium disilicate fusing (CAD-F-E), and 6) veneered zirconia by feldspathic
      ceramic cementing (CAD-C-CB). The specimens were divided into control and aging
      groups (n = 10 per group). The aging process included both thermocycling and
      mechanical loading and was followed by fracture resistance testing. All specimens
      in the M-E, M-TZI, and V-L groups survived; however, all specimens in the V-P
      group were fractured during artificial aging. The highest fracture resistance
      values were observed in the M-TZI group. According to the fracture resistance
      test, connector fractures were the most frequent type of failure. M-TZI and M-E
      FDPs revealed no failures during aging and showed higher fracture resistance than
      the veneered groups. Among the veneered zirconia framework groups, V-L FDPs
      showed the highest success rate during aging, while the fracture resistance was
      similar among all the veneered zirconia groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goals of this research are: (1) to determine the clinical survival
      of ceramic-ceramic 3-unit implant supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs)
      compared with control metal-ceramic and; (2) to analyze the effects of design
      parameters such as connector height, radius of curvature of gingival embrasure,
      and occlusal veneer thickness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, controlled
      clinical trial enrolled 96 participants with 129 3-unit implant-supported FDPs.
      Participants were randomized to receive different design combinations to include 
      FDP material, thickness of occlusal veneer ceramic, radius of curvature of
      gingival embrasure and connector height. Participants were recalled for 6 months,
      1year and yearly thereafter for the next 5 years. FDPs were examined for evidence
      of fracture and radiographs were made to assess viability of implants.
      Fractographic analyses and Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to analyze the
      data. RESULTS: 27 FDPs, representing 21%, exhibited chipping fractures of the
      veneer during the 5-year observation period. There was no statistically
      significant effect of type of material, veneer thickness, radius of curvature of 
      gingival embrasure and connector height on occurrence of fracture. Fractographic 
      and occlusal analyses reveal that fractures originated from the occlusal surface 
      and that occlusion was the most important factor in determining survival.
      Stresses calculated at failure demonstrated lower values compared with in vitro
      data. CONCLUSION: Implant-supported ceramic-ceramic prosthesis is a viable
      alternative to metal-ceramic. Survival analysis for both materials were
      comparable and design parameters employed in this study did not affect survival
      as long as zirconia was used as the core material.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This in-vitro study was performed to compare the contact wear,
      fracture strength and failure mode of implant-supported all-ceramic single crowns
      manufactured with various fabrication and fixation concepts. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Fifty dental implants (Conelog O 4,3mm/L11mm, Camlog Biotechnologies AG)
      were embedded and treated with all-ceramic molar single-crowns. Three groups
      received hand-layered zirconia crowns (IPS e.max Ceram/ IPS e.max ZirCAD, Ivoclar
      Vivadent AG): CZL (cement-retained zirconia-based layered) group crowns were
      cemented conventionally, SZL (screw-retained zirconia-based layered) group crowns
      were screw-retained, MZL (modified zirconia-based layered) group crowns showed a 
      different coping design with screw retention. The specimens of SST
      (screw-retained sintering-technique) and SFL (screw-retained full-contour
      lithium-disilicate) group were CAD/CAM (Computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing) fabricated in the sintering technique (IPS e.max ZirCAD/IPS e.max 
      CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent AG) and full-contour of lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD, 
      Ivoclar Vivadent AG) respectively and screw-retained. All specimens underwent
      artificial aging, load until failure and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
      analysis. The received data were statistically compared (one-way ANOVA;
      Student-Newman-Keuls test; Mann-Whitney U-test) at a significance level of 5%.
      RESULTS: Mouth-motion fatigue testing caused two abutment fractures (SST group
      and SZL group) and two chipping events (CZL group). Specimens of MZL group showed
      statistically significant less contact wear compared to the other groups
      (p<0.001). There was no statistical difference between the groups in terms of the
      maximum fracture load. SEM-analysis showed a more homogenous structure and
      surface of CAD/CAM fabricated specimens towards manually veneered components.
      CONCLUSIONS: The mode of retention did not influence the fracture resistance but 
      the failure patterns of the specimens. CAD/CAM milled lithium-disilicate crowns
      seemed to be a preserving factor for dental implants. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The
      mode of retention and veneering influences the mechanical performance of
      implant-supported single crowns.

TI  - Zirconia-based versus metal-based single crowns veneered with overpressing
      ceramic for restoration of posterior endodontically treated teeth: 5-year results
      of a randomized controlled clinical study.
PG  - 56-63

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 5-year randomized controlled trial was to compare the
      longevity and clinical behavior of single posterior crowns made with pressable
      ceramic on zirconia and on metal frameworks, and if failures occur, to delineate 
      the contributing factors. METHODS: 72 patients, who needed the covering of at
      least a molar and/or premolar, were included in the study. All teeth were
      endodontically treated, with absence of periapical lesion or active
      periodontitis. Ninety single crowns were made with zirconia or metal framework
      and covered with pressable veneering ceramics. Two independent examiners assessed
      the survival of restorations at 6 months, 1-4 and 5 years after restoration
      placement including periapical radiographs, intraoral photographs, and USPHS
      modified criteria. The statistical analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier 
      method. RESULTS: One core fracture occurred in Zircad/Zirpress crowns and one
      metal ceramic crown was lost for root fracture. Chipping fracture of the
      veneering ceramic was detected in 2 metal-ceramic crowns and in 3 zirconia-based 
      crowns. The Estimate Cumulative Survival (ECS) and the Estimate Cumulative
      Success (ECSs) with standard deviation (SE) were respectively 97,73+/-2,19 and
      92,64+/-4,14 for zirconia-based crowns whereas 97,44+/-2,39 and 91,11+/-4,27 for 
      porcelain fused to metal crowns. CONCLUSIONS: The present randomized controlled
      trial shows that the survival of zirconia-based and metal-based single crowns is 
      similar over a follow-up period of 5 years. No significant differences in
      esthetic, functional and biological outcomes were demonstrated between the two
      groups. The main failure mode was the chipping fracture of the veneering ceramic 
      in both materials. Study number on ClinicalTrial.gov NCT02758457. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: According to the results of this clinical study, zirconia-based
      rehabilitations with overpressing veneering technique represent a valid
      alternative to metal-based for posterior single crown restorations.

PG  - 1265-1273
LID - 10.1111/clr.12731 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the success and survival rate
      of all-ceramic bi-layered implant-supported three-unit fixed dental prostheses
      (IS-FDPs) 3 years after implant placement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen
      patients (seven males, six females; age: 41-78 years) received two one-piece
      ceramic implants (alumina-toughened zirconia) each in the region of the premolars
      or the first molar and were finally restored with adhesively cemented bi-layered 
      zirconia-based IS-FDPs (3 in the maxilla, 10 in the mandible) composed of
      CAD/CAM-fabricated zirconia frameworks pressed-over with fluor-apatite
      glass-ceramic ingots. At prosthetic delivery and the follow-ups after 1, 2 and 3 
      years, the restorations were evaluated using modified United States Public Health
      Service (USPHS) criteria. Restorations with minor veneer chippings, a small-area 
      occlusal roughness, slightly soundable restoration margins, minimal contour
      deficiencies and tolerable color deviations were regarded as success. In case of 
      more distinct defects that could, however, be repaired to a clinically acceptable
      level, IS-FDPs were regarded as surviving. Kaplan-Meier plots were used for the
      success/survival analyses. To verify an impact on subjective patients'
      perceptions, satisfaction was evaluated by visual analog scales (VAS). RESULTS:
      All patients were seen 3 years after implant installation. No IS-FDP had to be
      replaced, resulting in 100% survival after a mean observation period of 29.5
      months (median: 30.7). At the 3-year follow-up, 7/13 IS-FDPs showed a veneer
      chipping, 13/13 an occlusal roughness and 12/13 minimal deficiencies of
      contour/color. Since six restorations showed a major chipping and/or a major
      occlusal roughness, the Kaplan-Meier success rate was 53.8%. However, patients'
      significantly improved perceptions of function, esthetics, sense, and speech at
      prosthetic delivery remained stable over time. CONCLUSION: Bi-layered
      zirconia/fluor-apatite IS-FDPs entirely survived the observation period but
      showed a high frequency of technical complications. Nevertheless, the treatment
      highly satisfied patients' expectations.

TI  - Technical complications and failures of zirconia-based prostheses supported by
      implants followed up to 7 years: a case series.
PG  - 544-52
LID - 10.11607/ijp.3807 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate technical complications and failures of zirconia-based fixed
      prostheses supported by implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients
      received zirconia-based single crowns (SCs) and fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) on
      implants in a private clinical setting between 2005 and 2010. One dentist
      performed all surgical and prosthetic procedures, and one master technician
      performed and coordinated all laboratory procedures. One-piece computer-aided
      design/ computer-assisted manufacture technology was used to fabricate abutments 
      and frameworks, which were directly connected at the implant level, where
      possible. All patients were involved in a recall maintenance program and were
      finally reviewed in 2012. Data on framework fractures, chipping of veneering
      ceramics, and other technical complications were recorded. The primary endpoint
      was failure of the prostheses, ie, the need for a complete remake. A life table
      analysis was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 289 implants supported 193
      zirconia-based prostheses (120 SCs and 73 FDPs) in 127 patients (51 men, 76
      women; average age: 62.5 +/- 13.4 years) who were reviewed in 2012. Twenty-five
      (13%) prostheses were cemented on 44 zirconia abutments and 168 (87%) prostheses 
      were screw-retained directly at the implant level. Fracture of 3 frameworks (1
      SC, 2 FDPs) was recorded, and significant chipping resulted in the remake of 3
      prostheses (1 SC, 2 FDPs). The 7-year cumulative survival rate was 96.4% +/-
      1.99%. Minor complications comprised 5 loose screws (these were retightened),
      small chips associated with 3 prostheses (these were polished), and dislodgement 
      of 3 prostheses (these were recemented). Overall, 176 prostheses remained free of
      technical problems. CONCLUSIONS: Zirconia-based prostheses screwed directly to
      implants are clinically successful in the short and medium term.

TI  - Three-unit posterior zirconia-ceramic fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) veneered
      with layered and milled (CAD-on) veneering ceramics: 1-year follow-up of a
      randomized controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 871-80
LID - 10.3290/j.qi.a34701 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial was
      to test posterior zirconia-ceramic fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) veneered with a
      computer-aided design/computer- assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) lithium disilicate
      veneering ceramic (CAD-on) and manually layered zirconia veneering ceramic with
      respect to survival of the FDPs, and technical and biologic outcomes. METHOD AND 
      MATERIALS: Sixty patients in need of one posterior three-unit FDP were included. 
      The zirconia frameworks were produced with a CAD/CAM system (Cerec inLab 3D/Cerec
      inEOS inLab). Thirty FDPs were veneered with a CAD/CAM lithium disilicate
      veneering ceramic (Cad-on) (test) and 30 were veneered with a layered zirconia
      veneering ceramic (control). For the clinical evaluation at baseline, 6, and 12
      months, the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria were used. The
      biologic outcome was judged by comparing the plaque control record (PCR),
      bleeding on probing (BOP), and probing pocket depth (PPD). Data were
      statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were examined at a mean
      follow-up of 13.9 months. At the 1-year follow-up the survival rate was 100% in
      the test and in the control group. No significant differences of the technical
      outcomes occurred. Major chipping occurred in the control group (n = 3) and
      predominantly minor chipping in the test group (minor n = 2, major n = 1). No
      biologic problems or differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: Both types of
      zirconia-ceramic FDPs exhibited very good clinical outcomes without differences
      between groups. Chipping occurred in both types of FDPs at small amounts, yet the
      extension of the chippings differed. The test FDPs predominantly exhibited minor 
      chipping, the control FDPs major chipping.

TI  - Digital workflow in full-arch implant rehabilitation with segmented minimally
      veneered monolithic zirconia fixed dental prostheses: 2-year clinical follow-up.
PG  - 5-13
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12323 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To illustrate a digital workflow in full-arch implant rehabilitation
      with minimally veneered monolithic zirconia and to report the outcomes including 
      technical complications. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Three patients (5 edentulous
      arches) received full-arch fixed implant rehabilitation with monolithic zirconia 
      and mild facial porcelain veneering involving a digital workflow. The incisal
      edges and occluding surface areas were milled out of monolithic zirconia to
      reduce the possibility of chipping. Porcelain veneering was applied on the facial
      aspect to improve the esthetic result. Outcomes and technical complications are
      reported after 2 years of clinical and radiographic follow-up. CONCLUSION:
      Implant and prosthesis survival rates were 100% after a short-term follow-up of 2
      years. Technical complications were encountered in one patient. They did not
      adversely affect prosthesis survival or patient satisfaction and were easily
      addressed. A digital workflow for the design and fabrication of full-arch
      monolithic zirconia implant fixed implant prostheses has benefits, but caution is
      necessary during CAD planning of the prosthesis to ensure a successful outcome.
      Long-term clinical studies are needed to corroborate the findings discussed in
      this report. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This article presents an integrated digital
      workflow that was implemented for the implant-prosthodontic rehabilitation of
      three edentulous patients with monolithic zirconia prostheses. Monolithic
      zirconia has been successfully incorporated in implant prosthodontics in an
      effort to reduce the technical complications associated with bilayered ceramics. 
      This workflow simplifies design and fabrication of the zirconia prostheses.
      However, caution should be taken during CAD planning of the prosthesis to make
      sure the zirconia cylinder is sufficiently thick at the interface with the
      titanium insert. Additionally, when cutback is planned for facial porcelain
      veneering, the functional occluding cusps and incisal edges should be fabricated 
      in monolithic zirconia to avoid chipping.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this review is to provide an in-depth description of 
      published work on the application of zirconia for dental implansts and
      restorations on titanium implants, with an emphasis on clinical studies from the 
      past dozen years with at least 1-year follow-up. METHODS: Online databases
      (Pubmed, Science Direct, Web of Science) were consulted on this topic. Published 
      work from 2007 to 2019 was collected, analyzed and pertinent articles were
      selected for inclusion on this review. RESULTS: No clear superiority has been
      documented in biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, physical properties or
      allergenicity with zirconia implants compared to titanium, notwithstanding an
      esthetic benefit. While short-term studies have been promising, larger
      multicentered, longitudinal and randomized clinical trials with success data are 
      required to validate zirconia as a viable alternative to the titanium implant and
      its design. Zirconia abutments with a titanium base have revealed a high survival
      rate and show no difference to metal. Bi-layered zirconia ceramic restorations
      are a valid treatment alternative to metal ceramic implant restorations for
      single crowns with similar biological complications and enhanced esthetics.
      Monolithic zirconia restorations hold promise to address the chipping incidence
      of the bi-layered ceramic restoration, but longer-term studies are necessary, and
      work needs to be done to improve their esthetics. The gingival feldspathic
      porcelain veneered monolithic zirconia complete arch prosthesis versus a resin
      metal prosthesis, in medium-term studies, offers a high survival rate and low
      mechanical complication rate, reduced laboratory costs, superior durability and
      wear characteristics, enhanced fit due to digital fabrication, availability of a 
      digital file for duplication in the future, acrylic try-for adjustment and
      approval, and reduced plaque and biofilm accumulation. SIGNIFICANCE: Zirconia is 
      a versatile material for implant prosthodontic application. Longer-term
      multi-centered studies are needed to assess success criteria and patient-related 
      outcomes measurements. Monolithic zirconia offers enhanced mechanical properties 
      for implant restorations, but development is needed to optimize esthetics.

TI  - A systematic review of the survival and complication rates of all-ceramic and
      metal-ceramic reconstructions after an observation period of at least 3 years.
      Part II: Fixed dental prostheses.
PG  - 86-96
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the 5-year
      survival rates and incidences of complications of all-ceramic fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) and to compare them with those of metal-ceramic FDPs. METHODS: 
      An electronic MEDLINE and Dental Global Publication Research System search
      complemented by manual searching was conducted to identify prospective and
      retrospective cohort studies on all-ceramic and metal-ceramic reconstructions
      with a mean follow-up time of at least 3 years. Patients had to have been
      examined clinically at the follow-up visit. Assessment of the identified studies 
      and data abstraction was performed independently by three reviewers. Failure
      rates were analyzed using standard and random-effects Poisson regression models
      to obtain summary estimates of 5-year survival proportions. RESULTS: The search
      provided 3473 titles for single crowns and FDPs and resulted in 100 abstracts for
      all-ceramic FDPs. Full-text analysis was performed for 39 articles, resulting in 
      nine studies of ceramic FDPs that met the inclusion criteria. The data on
      survival and complication rates of metal-ceramic FDPs were obtained from a
      previous systematic review of Tan et al. (2004) and the updated version from the 
      same authors (Pjetursson et al. 2007). In Poisson regression meta-analysis, the
      5-year survival of metal-ceramic FDPs was significantly (P<0.0001) higher with
      94.4% [95 confidence interval (CI): 91.1-96.5%] than the survival of all-ceramic 
      FDPs, being 88.6% (95 CI: 78.3-94.2%). The frequencies of material fractures
      (framework and veneering material) were significantly (P<0.0001) higher for
      all-ceramic FDPs (6.5% and 13.6%) compared with those of metal-ceramic FDPs (1.6%
      and 2.9%). Other technical complications like loss of retention and biological
      complications like caries and loss of pulp vitality were similar for the two
      types of reconstructions over the 5-year observation period. CONCLUSION: Based on
      the present systematic review of all-ceramic FDPs, significantly lower survival
      rates at 5 years were seen compared with metal-ceramic FDPs. The most frequent
      reason for failure of FDPs made out of glass-ceramics or glass-infiltrated
      ceramics was fracture of the reconstruction (framework and veneering ceramic).
      However, when zirconia was used as framework material, the reasons for failure
      were primarily biological and technical complications other than framework
      fracture.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: It was the aim of this clinical study to evaluate the long-term
      outcome of 3- to 4-unit posterior all-ceramic fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) made
      from veneered zirconia ceramic. METHODS: Between June 2003 and February 2005, 48 
      patients received 58 restorations. Twenty-four FDPs had a fixed-to-fixed design
      (FF) and thirty-four FDPs had a cantilever design (CA). Frameworks were scanned
      and milled out of 3mol% yttrium-oxide partially-stabilized zirconia ceramic
      (CerconBase30, Degudent) and were veneered with feldspathic ceramic
      (CerconCeramS, Degudent). All FDPs were cemented with glass-ionomer cement
      (Ketac-Cem, 3MEspe) after air-abrading the inner crown surfaces. RESULTS: The
      mean observation period was 85.4+/-54 (FF) and 91.7+/-50 (CA) months,
      respectively. Ten cantilever FDPs and 5 fixed FDPs were lost due to biological
      problems of the abutment teeth. Two cantilever FDPs and 4 fixed-to-fixed FDPs
      were lost due to technical failures of the ceramic materials. The cumulative
      13-year survival rate was 43.2% (FF) (CI: 22.8-66.2%) and 52.5% (CA) (CI:
      32.5-71.8), respectively. In 13 cases, intraoral repair or polishing of the
      fractured feldspathic ceramic veneers was needed (7 in group FF, 6 in CA). Eight 
      abutments of six restorations (4 in FF, 4 in CA) had to be treated endodontically
      and caries therapy was needed in 6 abutment teeth (4 in group FF, 2 in CA). The
      cumulative 13-year success rate was 29.5% (FF) (CI: 12.1-55.9%) and 22.5% (CA)
      (CI: 7.9-49.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the present
      investigation, posterior fixed dental prostheses made from veneered zirconia with
      either a fixed-to fixed or a cantilever design show comparable survival and
      success rates after 13 years of clinical observation. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: FDPs
      made from veneered zirconia ceramic present high failure and complication rates, 
      irrespective of the design (fixed-to-fixed or cantilevered).

TI  - Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial of All-Ceramic Single Tooth Implant
      Reconstructions Using Modified Zirconia Abutments: Radiographic and Prosthetic
      Results at 1 Year of Loading.
PG  - 462-72
LID - 10.1111/cid.12333 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to test whether or not veneering of the submucosal part 
      of zirconia abutments with pink dental ceramic affects radiographic and technical
      outcomes of implant-supported single crowns (ISSC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single
      tooth implants were randomly restored with either pink-veneered zirconia
      abutments (test; n = 10) or non-veneered zirconia abutments (control group; n =
      10) and all-ceramic crowns. At baseline (crown insertion), and 6- and 12-month
      radiographic and technical evaluations were performed including standardized
      x-rays and modified United States Public Health Service criteria (technical).
      Survival and complication rates were assessed for implants and restorations.
      Robust linear mixed model analysis was performed to investigate the effect of
      group and time-point on radiographic outcomes. RESULTS: At 1 year, the survival
      rate for implants was 100% and 95% for ISSC. Most of the implants were placed
      subcrestally. Therefore, mean marginal bone levels decreased in both groups
      between implant insertion and baseline (p < .05), but then remained stable up to 
      1 year (test: 0.15 mm +/- 0.42 mm; control 0.23 mm +/- 0.63 mm) (p > .005). At 6 
      months, one minor chipping occurred in the test group. At 1 year, three crowns
      (control) exhibited occlusal roughness. In addition, one abutment fracture
      occurred (test). The differences between test and control group were not
      statistically significantly different for any of the evaluated outcome measures
      (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Veneering of the submucosal part of zirconia abutments
      did not affect biological and technical outcomes of ISSCs. Technical
      complications of the reconstructions, however, were frequent, resulting in a rate
      of 75% of the crowns being complication free.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to determine the
      success rate of single-unit posterior fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with
      zirconia copings generated with two CAD/CAM systems, compared to
      porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) single-unit posterior FDPs after 5 years of
      function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2005 to 2006, 60 patients who needed a
      single-unit FDP on a first molar in the mandibular jaw (left or right) in a
      private office setting were included in this study. The 60 first mandibular
      molars were randomly divided into three groups (n = 20): in the control group
      (group C), 20 PFM FDPs were included. In the other two groups CAD/CAM technology 
      was used for the fabrication of the zirconium-oxide copings: 20 single-unit
      posterior FDPs with zirconia copings were generated with the Procera system
      (group P, Nobel Biocare); 20 single-unit posterior FDPs with zirconia copings
      were generated with the Lava system (group L, 3M ESPE). For the ANOVA follow-up
      data, the clinical life table method was applied. The statistical analysis was
      performed using two nonparametric tests, the log-rank test for k-groups and the
      Fisher exact test. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in the
      clinical outcome of zirconia-ceramic FDPs of both groups (P and L) evaluated
      together and metal-ceramic posterior single FDPs was found at 5 years of
      function; however, clinical data showed that technical problems, such as extended
      fracture of the veneering ceramic, tended to occur more frequently in the
      zirconia-ceramic FDP groups. The difference in the frequency of failure was
      statistically significant only in the comparison of groups C and P. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Even if no statistically significant difference in the clinical outcome of
      zirconia-ceramic FDPs of both groups (P and L) considered together and
      metal-ceramic posterior single FDPs was found at 5 years of function, clinical
      data showed that the two zirconia-ceramic FDP groups tended to have more frequent
      clinical problems: for this reason all the clinical and technical variables
      related to the use of zirconia-ceramic FDPs generated with CAD/CAM systems should
      be carefully considered prior to all treatment procedures.

      results of a case series.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Today, only scarce information is available on monolithic zirconia
      reconstructions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of
      monolithic zirconia for tooth- and implant-borne reconstructions. METHOD AND
      MATERIALS: Monolithic zirconia single crowns (SCs) and fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs) supported by implants or teeth were included in this study. Implant
      placement and prosthetic treatment were done in the same clinical setting. One
      technician performed all laboratory work using the same CAD/CAM workflow
      (DentalDesigner, Ceramill Motion 2, Amann Girrbach). The endpoints were technical
      outcome, color match, marginal adaptation, anatomical form, and biologic aspects.
      The modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria and periodontal
      parameters were applied for the clinical evaluation by two independent examiners.
      Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used for statistical
      comparisons. RESULTS: Forty patients (17 men, 23 women, mean age 59.1+/-14.7
      years) with 109 reconstructions (74 SCs, 35 FDPs) supported by 38 implants and 71
      teeth were assessed, resulting in a total of 238 monolithic zirconia units
      (including 62 pontics and 18 cantilevers). Median follow-up time was 23.8 months 
      (12 to 36 months). No technical failures were observed. The total prosthesis
      survival rate was 99.6% (teeth, 100%; implants, 98.4%) due to the loss of one
      implant. The periodontal/peri-implant parameters stand for healthy tissue, and
      caries was not detected. The records obtained by the USPHS revealed good clinical
      outcomes. CONCLUSION: These short-term results indicate that monolithic zirconia 
      reconstructions for teeth and implants may be a satisfactory treatment option,
      particularly in the posterior region.

      zirconia restorations.
PG  - 725-9
LID - 10.3290/j.qi.a36567 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Due to the high chipping rates observed in veneered zirconia ceramic 
      restorations, the use of monolithic zirconia restorations has been recommended.
      This study tried to compare veneered and monolithic zirconia fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) with respect to the amount of damage induced by endodontic
      access preparation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Monolithic and ceramic veneered (n=10) 
      three-unit restorations (retainers: first premolar and first molar; pontic:
      second premolar) were subject to endodontic access cavity preparation in both
      retainers using a diamond rotary instrument under continuous water cooling. The
      number of chipping fractures and microfractures detected using the fluorescent
      penetrant method were recorded. Statistical analysis was based on Wilcoxon rank
      sum tests with Bonferroni correction (level of significance alpha=.05). RESULTS: 
      Only one microfracture could be identified in the group of monolithic FDPs while 
      a maximum of seven microfractures and three chipping fractures per retainer crown
      were recorded in the group of veneered restorations. At the premolar site, the
      veneered restorations showed significantly more microfractures (P=.0055) and
      chipping fractures (P=.0008). At the molar site, no significant difference with
      respect to microfractures could be detected (P=.0767), while significantly more
      chipping fractures occurred in the veneered samples (P=.0293). CONCLUSION:
      Monolithic zirconia restorations seem to be less susceptible to damage when
      endodontic access cavities have to be prepared as compared to veneered zirconia
      reconstructions. However, no conclusions can be drawn on the long-term
      performance of a specific restoration based on this study.

      men; age range 52-75 years) were recruited for the study to receive a three-unit 
      implant-supported fixed dental prosthesis (FDP). Two implants were placed for
      each of the 72 FDPs in the study. The implants (Osseospeed, Astra Tech), which
      were made of titanium, were grit blasted. A gold-shaded, custom-milled titanium
      abutment (Atlantis, Astra Tech), was secured to each implant body. Each of the 72
      FDPs in 55 patients were randomly assigned based on one of the following options:
      (1) A. MATERIAL: ceramic-ceramic (Yttria-stabilized zirconia core, pressable
      fluorapatite glass-ceramic, IPS e.max ZirCAD, and ZirPress, Ivoclar Vivadent) B. 
      metal-ceramic (palladium-based noble alloy, Capricorn, Ivoclar Vivadent, with
      press-on leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic veneer, IPS InLine POM, Ivoclar
      Vivadent); (2) occlusal veneer thickness (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mm); (3) curvature of
      gingival embrasure (0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mm diameter); and (4) connector height
      (3, 4, and 5 mm). FDPs were fabricated and cemented with dual-cure resin cement
      (RelyX, Universal Cement, 3M ESPE). Patients were recalled at 6 months, 1 year,
      and 2 years. FDPs were examined for cracks, fracture, and general surface
      quality. RESULTS: Recall exams of 72 prostheses revealed 10 chipping fractures.
      No fractures occurred within the connector or embrasure areas. Two-sided Fisher's
      exact tests showed no significant correlation between fractures and type of
      material system (p = 0.51), veneer thickness (p = 0.75), radius of curvature of
      gingival embrasure (p = 0.68), and connector height (p = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS:
      Although there were no significant associations between connector height,
      curvature of gingival embrasure, core/veneer thickness ratio, and material system
      and the survival probability of implant-supported FDPs with zirconia as a core
      material, the small number of fractures precludes a definitive conclusion on the 
      dominant controlling factor.

      Committee on Research in Fixed Prosthodontics of the American Academy of Fixed
      Prosthodontics.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Zirconia and lithium disilicate have been commonly used as 
      materials for tooth-supported complete-coverage restorations. Adhesive and
      conventional cements have been suggested for cementation of these restorations.
      However, evidence on the effect of cement type on the clinical outcomes of teeth 
      restored with zirconia or lithium disilicate restorations is unclear. PURPOSE:
      The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of
      teeth restored with zirconia or lithium disilicate restorations when adhesive or 
      conventional cements are used. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This systematic review
      adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
      (PRISMA) statement and was registered at the international prospective register
      of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42018096493). An electronic search was
      performed in 2 databases (MEDLINE-PubMed and Cochrane Central), and a manual
      search, from January 2008 through January 2018. The primary clinical question was
      framed according to the Problem/Patient/Population, Intervention/Indicator,
      Comparison, Outcome (PICO) approach. The following question was the primary
      clinical question: ""For patients requiring a single tooth-supported
      complete-coverage ceramic restoration, does adhesive cementation, as compared
      with conventional cementation, improve the clinical performance and limit the
      complications of this restoration?"" The search included articles published in
      peer-reviewed journals in English and was limited to randomized clinical trials
      and prospective and retrospective clinical studies. RESULTS: Seventeen clinical
      studies met the eligibility criteria and were included for qualitative analysis. 
      Included studies had 1280 participants who received 2436 zirconia and lithium
      disilicate crowns. The survival rates for adhesively cemented zirconia crowns
      ranged from 83.3% to 100%, whereas those reported for conventionally cemented
      zirconia crowns ranged from 82.0% to 100%. Survival rates for adhesively cemented
      lithium disilicate crowns ranged from 83.5% to 100%, whereas the survival rate
      reported for conventionally cemented lithium disilicate crowns was 98.5%.
      Commonly reported clinical complications included fracture of the veneering
      ceramic, crown fracture, and loss of crown retention. The mean follow-up time
      ranged from 25.5 months to 121.2 months. The studies that were assessed for risk 
      of bias showed poor quality of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available
      evidence and within the limitations of this systematic review, zirconia and
      lithium disilicate tooth-supported crowns exhibited comparable survival rates and
      complication patterns after adhesive or conventional cementation.

AB  - Zirconia implants that were restored with veneered zirconia displayed severe
      chipping rates of the restorations in clinical studies. Purpose of this study was
      to evaluate the fracture load of different zirconia implant supported monolithic 
      crown materials (zirconia, alumina, lithium disilicate, feldspar ceramic and
      polymer-infiltrated ceramic) cemented with various cements (Harvard LuteCem SE,
      Harvard Implant Semi-permanent, Multilink Automix, VITA Adiva F-Cem). Flexural
      strength and fracture toughness of crown materials and compressive strength of
      the cements were measured. Fracture load values of crowns fabricated from lithium
      disilicate, feldspar ceramic and polymer-infiltrated ceramic were increased when 
      cement with high compressive strength was used. Fracture loads for zirconia and
      alumina crowns were not influenced by the cement. Flexural strength and fracture 
      toughness of the ceramics correlated linearly with the respective fracture load
      when using adhesive cement with high compressive strength. To achieve sufficient 
      fracture load values, cementation with adhesive cement is essential for feldspar 
      and polymer-infiltrated ceramic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present pilot study was to test whether or not
      posterior zirconia-ceramic fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with pressed veneering 
      ceramic exhibit less chipping than FDPs with layered veneering ceramics. METHODS:
      Forty patients (13 female, 27 male; mean age 54 years (range 26.1-80.7 years) in 
      need of one maxillary or mandibular three-unit FDP in the second premolar or
      molar region were recruited and treated at two separate centers at the University
      of Zurich according to the same study protocol. The frameworks were made out of
      zirconia using a CAD/CAM system (Cerec Sirona, Bensheim, Germany). The patients
      were randomly assigned to either the test group (zirconia frameworks veneered
      with pressed ceramic; IPS e.max ZirPress, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan,
      Liechtenstein; n=20) or the control group (layered veneering ceramic; IPS e.max
      Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein; n=20). All FDPs were
      adhesively cemented and evaluated at baseline (i.e., cementation), at 6 months
      and at 1 and 3 years of clinical service. The survival of the reconstruction was 
      recorded. The technical outcome was assessed using modified United States Public 
      Health Services (USPHS) criteria. The biologic parameters analyzed at abutment
      teeth and analogous non-restored teeth included probing pocket depth (PPD),
      plaque control record (PCR), bleeding on probing (BOP), and tooth vitality (CO2).
      Data was descriptively analyzed and survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier
      statistics. RESULTS: 36 patients (25 female, 11 male; mean age 52.3 years) with
      18 test and 18 control FDPs were examined after a mean follow-up of 36 months
      (95% CI: 32.6-39.1 months). Comparison of groups was done by Crosstabulation
      showing even distribution of the respective restored teeth amidst the groups.
      Survival rate was 100% for both test and control FDPs. Chipping of the veneering 
      ceramic tended to occur more frequently in test (n=8; 40%) than in control (n=4; 
      20%) FDPs, albeit not significantly (p=0.3). No further differences of the
      technical outcomes of test and control FDPs occurred.In both test and control
      group healthy conditions and no difference of the biologic parameters at the
      abutment and un-restored teeth was found. CONCLUSION: Zirconia FDPs with pressed 
      and layered veneering ceramics exhibited similar outcomes at 3 years. A trend to 
      more chipping of the pressed veneering ceramic, however, was observed. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: Posterior restorations with zirconia frameworks are a viable
      treatment method. When restoring posterior teeth with all-ceramic restorations,
      care providers should be aware of the higher rate of chipping compared to the
      published data on conventional metal-ceramic restorations.

TI  - Fracture mode during cyclic loading of implant-supported single-tooth
      restorations.
PG  - 74-83
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(12)60110-3 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Fracture of veneering ceramics in zirconia-based
      restorations has frequently been reported. Investigation of the fracture mode of 
      implant-supported ceramic restorations by using clinically relevant laboratory
      protocols is needed. PURPOSE: This study compared the mode of fracture and number
      of cyclic loads until veneering fracture when ceramic and metal ceramic
      restorations with different veneering ceramics were supported by implants.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two implant-supported single-tooth restorations were
      fabricated. The test group was composed of 16 ceramic restorations of zirconia
      abutment-retained crowns with zirconia copings veneered with glass-ceramics (n=8)
      and feldspathic ceramics (n=8). The control group was composed of 16 metal
      ceramic restorations of titanium abutment-retained crowns with gold alloy copings
      veneered with glass (n=8) and feldspathic ceramics (n=8). The palatal surfaces of
      the crowns were exposed to cyclic loading of 800 N with a frequency of 2 Hz,
      which continued to 4.2 million cycles or until fracture of the copings,
      abutments, or implants. The number of cycles and the fracture modes were
      recorded. The fracture modes were analyzed by descriptive analysis and the
      Mann-Whitney test (alpha=.05). The differences in loading cycles until veneering 
      fracture were estimated with the Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS:
      Veneering fracture was the most frequently observed fracture mode. The severity
      of fractures was significantly more in ceramic restorations than in metal ceramic
      restorations. Significantly more loading cycles until veneering fracture were
      estimated with metal ceramic restorations veneered with glass-ceramics than with 
      other restorations. CONCLUSIONS: The metal ceramic restorations demonstrated
      fewer and less severe fractures and resisted more cyclic loads than the ceramic
      restorations, particularly when the metal ceramic crowns were veneered with
      glass-ceramics.

TI  - Monolithic Lithium Disilicate Full-Contour Crowns Bonded on CAD/CAM Zirconia
      Complete-Arch Implant Bridges With 3 to 5 Years of Follow-Up.
PG  - 450-8
LID - 10.1563/AAID-JOI-D-13-00133 [doi]
AB  - This study was carried on to assess the clinical performance of a novel
      restorative concept consisting in single monolithic lithium disilicate
      full-contour crowns bonded on computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing 
      (CAD/CAM) zirconia complete-arch implant bridges, to overcome the drawbacks
      related to the chipping of porcelain fused to zirconia restorations. Sixteen
      patients received 18 implant-supported hybrid screw-cement-retained complete-arch
      restorations, consisting of single monolithic lithium disilicate full-contour
      crowns bonded on CAD/CAM zirconia frameworks. The restorations were supported by 
      4-8 implants. All patients were followed up for at least 3 years on function
      (range 36 to 60 months, mean 49.3 months). Clinical controls were scheduled every
      4 months. The outcomes were implant and prosthetic survival and success rates,
      any complications, patient satisfaction, and soft tissue parameters. No dropouts 
      occurred. The overall implant and prosthesis survival rates were 100%. One of 18 
      restorations (1 of 236 dental units) showed a chip-off fracture of the veneering 
      ceramic that was polished intraorally without any additional treatment, scoring a
      cumulative prosthetic success rate of 100%, according to the California Dental
      Association index. All patients were functionally and esthetically highly
      satisfied with their restorations. Successful soft tissue parameters were found
      around all implants. Single monolithic lithium disilicate full-contour crowns,
      bonded on CAD/CAM screw-retained complete-arch zirconia frameworks, showed
      favorable preliminary outcomes with medium-term follow-up. However, randomized
      controlled studies of this technique are required for further conclusive
      recommendations.

TI  - Implant-supported fixed dental prostheses with CAD/CAM-fabricated porcelain crown
      and zirconia-based framework.
PG  - 402-7
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12001 [doi]
AB  - Recently, fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with a hybrid structure of CAD/CAM
      porcelain crowns adhered to a CAD/CAM zirconia framework (PAZ) have been
      developed. The aim of this report was to describe the clinical application of a
      newly developed implant-supported FDP fabrication system, which uses PAZ, and to 
      evaluate the outcome after a maximum application period of 36 months. Implants
      were placed in three patients with edentulous areas in either the maxilla or
      mandible. After the implant fixtures had successfully integrated with bone,
      gold-platinum alloy or zirconia custom abutments were first fabricated. Zirconia 
      framework wax-up was performed on the custom abutments, and the CAD/CAM zirconia 
      framework was prepared using the CAD/CAM system. Next, wax-up was performed on
      working models for porcelain crown fabrication, and CAD/CAM porcelain crowns were
      fabricated. The CAD/CAM zirconia frameworks and CAD/CAM porcelain crowns were
      bonded using adhesive resin cement, and the PAZ was cemented. Cementation of the 
      implant superstructure improved the esthetics and masticatory efficiency in all
      patients. No undesirable outcomes, such as superstructure chipping,
      stomatognathic dysfunction, or periimplant bone resorption, were observed in any 
      of the patients. PAZ may be a potential solution for ceramic-related clinical
      problems such as chipping and fracture and associated complicated repair
      procedures in implant-supported FDPs.

TI  - Clinical performance of chairside monolithic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic
      CAD-CAM crowns.
PG  - 613-619
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12531 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical performance and the effect of various
      patient and provider-related factors on the longevity of chairside monolithic
      posterior lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LDGC) computer-aided design
      (CAD)-computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) crowns provided by predoctoral students.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of posterior LDGC CAD-CAM crowns was evaluated.
      Crown preparations were milled chairside using the CEREC Omnicam system and
      cemented with Rely-X Unicem or Calibra Universal resin cements. Clinical
      assessment of the crowns and supporting periodontal structures was performed
      using the modified California Dental Association (CDA) criteria. Intraoral
      photographs as well as radiographs were taken for further assessment by two
      evaluators. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 40 
      crowns were inserted in 32 patients and evaluated for 4 years. Three
      complications were observed (two-technical and one-biological). No chipping or
      fracture of crowns was observed. No significant association was found between
      age, sex, periodontal condition, tooth type, tooth vitality, cement type, and
      longevity. The 4-year cumulative survival and success rates were 95.0 and 92.3%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Chairside LDGC CAD-CAM crowns exhibited a high survival
      rate after 4 years in function and were shown to be a viable and reliable
      treatment option for posterior teeth. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The high survival
      rate of chairside CAD-CAM crowns observed in this study suggests the likelihood
      of predictable performance in the predoctoral setup.

TI  - Tooth-implant-supported posterior fixed dental prostheses with zirconia
      frameworks: 3-year clinical result.
PG  - 1079-86
LID - 10.1007/s00784-015-1594-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This case series compared the clinical survival of
      tooth-implant-supported (TI-S) and tooth-supported (T-S) three-unit fixed dental 
      prostheses (FDPs) with zirconia frameworks and described the incidence of
      biological and technical complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four
      patients received 27 TI-S FDPs and 22 T-S FDPs. Twenty-seven titanium screw
      implants were inserted at the dislodged position of two missing posterior teeth. 
      All implants were provided with customized zirconia abutments. Zirconia
      frameworks were fabricated by a CAD/CAM system and veneered in powder build-up
      technique. All restorations were cemented with glass ionomer. Baseline evaluation
      was performed 2 weeks after cementation with recall examinations performed at 6, 
      12, 24 and 36 months by calibrated investigators. Survival probabilities
      according to Kaplan-Meier were calculated. Gingival parameters and bone loss were
      assessed and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: The mean service time of the FDPs 
      was 35 months (+/-6). Two technical complications (fracture of veneering
      porcelain) were observed. One biological complication was recorded. The
      Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 93.9 % for all types of complications and
      100 % related to restorations in service. The type of abutment support (TI-S vs. 
      T-S) had no significant influence on the survival probability (p = 0.412, log
      rank test). No difference of the gingival parameters was detected between
      implants and natural teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Tooth-implant-supported zirconia-based
      FDPs showed similar clinical performance compared to tooth-supported
      zirconia-based FDPs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Within the limitations of this case
      series, tooth-implant-supported FDPs with zirconia frameworks seem to be a
      reliable treatment option.

TI  - CAD/CAM-fabricated ceramic implant-supported single crowns made from lithium
      disilicate: Final results of a 5-year prospective cohort study.
PG  - 876-883
LID - 10.1111/cid.12508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: All-ceramic bilayer systems suffer from technique-sensitivity,
      resulting in increased technical complication rates. This might be overcome by
      monolithic reconstructions, facilitating digital workflows. PURPOSE: To evaluate 
      the clinical and patient-reported outcome of CAD/CAM-fabricated implant-supported
      single crowns (ISCs) made of lithium disilicate (LS2 ) cemented on ceramic
      implants 5 years after implant installation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four
      patients were included in the study. All participants received a one-piece
      ceramic implant in anterior (4 incisors) and posterior regions (10 premolars, 10 
      molars). LS2 crowns were computer-aided designed (CAD), manufactured (CAM) and
      adhesively luted onto the implants. Follow-ups were performed yearly up to 60
      months after implant installation. The survival/success rates of the restorations
      were calculated according to modified US Public Health Service criteria as
      follows: Clinically relevant defects that could be repaired intraorally were
      accepted for survival, whereas small-area chippings, roughness (o < 2 mm),
      slightly soundable marginal gaps, minimal undercontours/overcontours, and
      tolerable color deviations were accepted for success. Kaplan-Meier plots were
      used for the success/survival analyses. Furthermore, patient-reported outcome
      measures (PROMs) were assessed by applying visual analog scales (VAS). Linear
      (PROMs) and logistic (USPHS criteria) mixed models were fitted to evaluate time
      effects on response variables. RESULTS: Twenty-two ISCs could be evaluated 55.2
      +/- 4.2 months after prosthetic delivery. Two patients were reported as drop-outs
      (1 died, 1 moved abroad). No failures were observed, resulting in 100% survival. 
      At two ISCs, a major-roughness had to be treated. This resulted in a Kaplan-Meier
      success estimate of 91.7% (95%CI: 70.6%-97.9%). Compared with pretreatment, all
      surveys at prosthetic delivery except for self-esteem (P = .375) showed
      significantly improved VAS scores. No decrease in satisfaction could be observed 
      over time until the end of follow-up (P >/= .056). CONCLUSION: Concerning
      survival/success rates and PROMs, the evaluated crown-implant system showed
      favorable mid-term results. To date, there are no comparable data available for
      implant-supported ISCs made of LS2 .

TI  - Clinical performance of tooth- or implant-supported veneered zirconia single
      crowns: 42-month results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this clinical study was to compare and assess the
      clinical performance of tooth-supported and implant-supported zirconia single
      crowns with sintered veneering caps. METHODS: In this prospective study, 118
      patients with a total of 220 single crowns placed on 106 teeth (69 vital teeth,
      37 endodontically treated teeth) and 114 implants in molar and premolar regions
      were examined during a mean observation period of 42 months. The restorations
      were evaluated for technical failures such as veneering porcelain fractures
      (chipping), surface quality, marginal fit, and the interface quality of the
      coping and sintered veneering. The soft tissue status was assessed using the
      modified Silness and Loe's plaque and gingival index (mPI) and the modified
      Muhlemann sulcus bleeding index (mSBI). Tooth-supported crowns were checked for
      secondary caries and hypersensitivity during the follow-up period. Recalls were
      performed every 6 months. RESULTS: The 3-year Kaplan-Meier success probability
      was 98.2% and 100% for implant- and tooth-supported crowns, respectively. A
      significant difference could be detected between the implant-supported and
      tooth-supported zirconia single crowns, in terms of their chipping rate (p =
      0.039). Veneering material fractures were recorded on two implant-supported
      restorations (1.8%). No veneering fractures occurred on tooth-supported single
      crowns. The plaque and gingival index and sulcus bleeding index showed stable and
      healthy soft peri-implant and periodontal tissues. Neither loss of vitality nor
      secondary caries occurred on tooth-supported crowns. CONCLUSIONS: Zirconia-based 
      single crowns with a sintered veneering cap showed promising clinical results on 
      both tooth and implant abutments; however, the dental implants were more prone to
      complications. In terms of clinical significance, high-strength ceramic with a
      sintered veneering cap can be recommended for prosthetic treatment of both tooth-
      and implant-supported single crowns in molar regions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This
      study provides valuable information for further application of all-ceramic
      restorations.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A clinician must decide what ceramic coping and veneer
      material to prescribe based on the amount of tooth reduction possible and the
      desired esthetic outcome of the restoration. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in
      vitro study was to compare the fracture strength of monolithic and bilayered
      lithium disilicate (IPS e.max) and zirconia (LAVA) crowns at clinically relevant 
      thicknesses after load cycling. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Crowns (n=8) were
      fabricated from 6 groups: 1.2-mm monolithic lithium disilicate, 1.5-mm monolithic
      lithium disilicate, 1.5-mm bilayered lithium disilicate with hand-layered veneer,
      0.6 mm monolithic zirconia, 1.2-mm bilayered zirconia with hand-layered veneer,
      and 1.2-mm bilayered zirconia with milled veneer (dimension represents thickness 
      at the occlusal pit). Crowns were cemented to identical milled resin dies with
      resin-modified glass ionomer cement. Cemented crowns were stored at 37 degrees C 
      for 24 hours and load cycled for 200,000 cycles at 25 N at a rate of 40
      cycles/minute. The ultimate fracture load for each specimen was measured in a
      universal testing machine. Data were analyzed with a 1-way ANOVA and Tukey honest
      significant difference post hoc analysis (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Mean +/-SD
      fracture load values were 1465 +/-330 N for monolithic lithium disilicate (1.2-mm
      thickness) and 2027 +/-365 N (1.5-mm thickness) and 1732 +/-315 N for bilayered
      hand-veneered lithium disilicate (1.5-mm thickness). Fracture loads were 1669
      +/-311 N for monolithic zirconia crowns (0.6mm thickness), 2625 +/-300 N for
      zirconia milled-veneered (1.2-mm thickness), and 2655 +/-590N for zirconia
      hand-veneered crowns (1.2mm thickness). One-way ANOVA showed a statistically
      significant difference among the groups (P<.01). Veneered zirconia crowns showed 
      the highest fracture strength, 1.2-mm hand veneered zirconia was similar to that 
      of 1.5-mm monolithic zirconia, and all other groups were not statistically
      different. CONCLUSIONS: Crowns of 1.2-mm bilayered zirconia had higher fracture
      loads than 0.6-mm zirconia or 1.2-mm lithium disilicate monolithic crowns.

TI  - Retrievable metal ceramic implant-supported fixed prostheses with milled titanium
      frameworks and all-ceramic crowns: retrospective clinical study with up to 10
      years of follow-up.
PG  - 256-64
LID - 10.1111/j.1532-849X.2011.00824.x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report on the outcome of metal ceramic 
      implant-supported fixed prostheses with milled titanium frameworks and
      all-ceramic crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical study included 108
      patients (67 women, 41 men), mean age of 58.6 years (range: 34-82), followed
      between 9 months and 10 years (post occlusal loading). The mean follow-up time
      for all patients in the study was 5 years. A total of 125 prostheses were
      fabricated. The data were divided into 2 groups. Development group (DG): 52
      patients with 66 prostheses (28 maxillary, 38 mandibular) fabricated with
      individual Procera crowns (Alumina copings, Nobel Biocare AB) and Allceram
      ceramics (Ducera Dental GmbH) cemented onto a CAD/CAM fabricated Ti framework
      (Nobel Biocare AB) with pink ceramic (Duceram, Ducera Dental GmbH) that
      replicated the missing gingival tissues. Routine group (RG): 56 patients with 59 
      prostheses (49 maxillary, 10 mandibular) fabricated with individual Procera
      crowns (Zirconia copings and Nobel Rondo Zirconia Ceramic; Nobel Biocare AB)
      cemented onto a CAD/CAM fabricated Ti framework (Nobel Biocare AB) with pink
      acrylic resin (PallaXpress Ultra, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH) that replicated the
      missing gingival tissues. Primary outcome measures were prosthetic survival and
      mechanical complications. Secondary outcome measures were biological
      complications testing the retrievability characteristic of the prosthesis.
      Survival estimates were calculated on the patient level with the Kaplan-Meier
      product limit estimator (95% confidence intervals [CI]). Data were analyzed with 
      descriptive and inferential analyses. RESULTS: The cumulative survival rates for 
      the implant-supported fixed prostheses were 92.4% for the DG at 10 years and 100%
      for the RG at 5 years (overall 96%) (Kaplan-Meier). Mechanical complications
      occurred in 44 patients (DG: 29 patients, 36 prostheses; RG: 15 patients, 16
      prostheses); the large majority were crown fractures, occurring in 48 patients
      (DG: 33 patients, 36 prostheses; RG: 15 patients, 16 prostheses). In the DG,
      univariate analysis of logistic regression disclosed the presence of a metal
      ceramic implant-supported fixed prosthesis opposing dentition as a risk factor
      for crown fracture (OR = 1.97). Biological complications occurred in 33 patients 
      (DG: 18 patients; RG: 15 patients), the majority being peri-implant pathologies
      in 19 patients (DG: 9 patients, RG: 10 patients). All situations were resolved
      except one in the DG that led to fixture and prosthesis loss. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results of this study indicated that, within the limitations of this study, the
      CAD/CAM protocol is acceptable for definitive prosthetic rehabilitation. This
      protocol provided these patients with a good prognosis on a middle- to long-term 
      basis (5 years).

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this retrospective study was to compare the incidence
      of chipping of implant-supported, all-ceramic, and metal-ceramic single crowns.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-three patients (51.7% male, mean age 55.0
      years) received 232 cemented implant-supported single crowns. One hundred and
      seventy-nine crowns had a metal framework (gold alloy) and 53 crowns were
      all-ceramic (zirconia framework and glass-ceramic veneer material). Age, gender, 
      kind of cementation, and location of the restorations were assessed as possible
      factors affecting chipping. RESULTS: During the observation period of up to 5.8
      years (mean 2.1 years; standard deviation 1.4), a total of 13 (24.5%) all-ceramic
      and 17 (9.5%) metal-ceramic crowns suffered from chipping, a difference that was 
      statistically significant. A total of ten single crowns had to be remade
      resulting in survival of 86.8% (all-ceramic) and 98.3% (metal-ceramic). The other
      possible factors did not have a significant effect on the chipping. CONCLUSION:
      Chipping was found to be more frequent for all-ceramic implant-supported single
      crowns. If the reasons for the vulnerability of all-ceramic crowns remain
      unknown, implants with all-ceramic single crowns should generally be recommended 
      with care.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of veneering material and framework design on
      fracture loads of implant-supported zirconia molar fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs). METHODS: Sixty-six zirconia FDPs were manufactured onto two implants and 
      classified as uniform thickness (UT) or anatomic design (AD). These framework
      design groups were then further divided into three subgroups (n=11): feldspathic 
      porcelain-veneered zirconia FDPs (PVZ), indirect composite-veneered zirconia FDPs
      (IVZ), and metal-ceramic FDPs (MC). The FDPs were luted on the implant abutments 
      and underwent fracture load testing. Significant differences were assessed by the
      Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U-test (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: For UT group, 
      median fracture load was significantly higher for the IVZ (1.87kN) and MC
      (1.90kN) specimens than for the PVZ specimens (1.38kN) (p<0.05). In the AD group,
      the IVZ specimens had the highest median fracture load (4.10kN) of the three
      groups tested. The AD group exhibited higher median fracture loads than the UT
      group in all subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect composite appears to be a useful
      alternative to feldspathic porcelain as the layering material for
      implant-supported zirconia FDPs. The AD group had higher fracture loads than UT
      group. In addition, implant-supported indirect composite-veneered zirconia-based 
      FDPs appear to be clinically feasible.

TI  - Fracture load of monolithic CAD/CAM lithium disilicate ceramic crowns and
      veneered zirconia crowns as a posterior implant restoration.
PG  - 66-70
LID - 10.1097/ID.0b013e318278a576 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the fracture load and failure mode of the monolithic lithium 
      disilicate crown (e.max group) and 2 types of veneered zirconia crowns, hand
      layer (ZV group) and heat pressed (ZP group), as a posterior implant-supported
      restoration. METHODS: A total of 24 all-ceramic crowns for molar tooth were
      fabricated using the computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture
      (CAD/CAM) system. The e.max group crowns and zirconia copings for ZV and ZP
      groups were fabricated using a Cerec milling unit. The ZV group was fabricated
      using a hand-layer veneering method, and the ZP group using a heat-pressing
      method. All crowns were luted to the abutments, which were connected to implant
      fixtures, using resin cement. Fracture load was measured using the universal
      testing machine, and the fracture surface was evaluated by scanning electron
      microscopy. RESULTS: The ZP group showed significantly higher fracture load
      (5229.3 N) compared with the e.max group (3852.1 N) and ZV group (3100.3 N). All 
      fractures in the ZV group occurred in the veneered layer. CONCLUSION: Monolithic 
      CAD/CAM lithium disilicate crowns are applicable to posterior implant-supported
      restorations because the fracture load was higher than the average occlusal
      force.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of zirconia based tooth- and implant-supported fixed
      dental prostheses: 3-year results.

LID - 10.1016/j.jdent.2014.10.011 [doi]
LID - S0300-5712(14)00305-4 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This prospective clinical study compared the performance of
      implant-retained (study group) and tooth-retained (control) zirconia based fixed 
      dental prostheses (FDPs) with at least 4 units. The null-hypothesis stated that
      complication rates in both groups are equally distributed. METHODS: The study
      included patients in need of one 4- to 6-unit implant- or tooth-retained FDP
      each. All patients were examined 2 weeks after insertion (baseline) and then at 6
      month intervals up to 3 years. At follow-up all restorations were examined for
      framework fracture, chipping, marginal integrity, surface roughness and
      biological complications. Kaplan-Meier estimation was used for data analysis.
      RESULTS: 20 patients received tooth-retained and 7 patients implant-retained
      FDPs. The study was halted early when differences in chipping rates reached a
      statistically significant level. One FDP in the study group was lost due to
      implant abutment failure. FDP related chipping rates were 71% in the study group 
      (mean observation time 32 months) and 15% in the control (mean observation time
      34 months). Unit (abutment crown/pontic) related chipping rates were 32% in the
      study group and 6% in the control. Chipping rates differed statistically
      significant (log-rank test, p<.05). However, all ceramic defects could be
      corrected by grinding and polishing. No framework fracture was detected.
      CONCLUSIONS: Within the study limitations, survival rates seem satisfactorily in 
      both implant- and tooth retained long-span zirconia based FDPs. However,
      implant-supported FDPs seem more susceptible to veneering ceramic chippings.
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The high chipping rates found in this study discourage the
      use of long-span implant-retained FDPs with zirconia frameworks. The study was
      registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with the ID Number NCT02220764.

TI  - The complete digital workflow in fixed prosthodontics: a systematic review.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/s12903-017-0415-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The continuous development in dental processing ensures new
      opportunities in the field of fixed prosthodontics in a complete virtual
      environment without any physical model situations. The aim was to compare fully
      digitalized workflows to conventional and/or mixed analog-digital workflows for
      the treatment with tooth-borne or implant-supported fixed reconstructions.
      METHODS: A PICO strategy was executed using an electronic (MEDLINE, EMBASE,
      Google Scholar) plus manual search up to 2016-09-16 focusing on RCTs
      investigating complete digital workflows in fixed prosthodontics with regard to
      economics or esthetics or patient-centered outcomes with or without follow-up or 
      survival/success rate analysis as well as complication assessment of at least 1
      year under function. The search strategy was assembled from MeSH-Terms and
      unspecific free-text words: {((""Dental Prosthesis"" [MeSH]) OR (""Crowns"" [MeSH])
      OR (""Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported"" [MeSH])) OR ((crown) OR (fixed dental 
      prosthesis) OR (fixed reconstruction) OR (dental bridge) OR (implant crown) OR
      (implant prosthesis) OR (implant restoration) OR (implant reconstruction))} AND
      {(""Computer-Aided Design"" [MeSH]) OR ((digital workflow) OR (digital technology) 
      OR (computerized dentistry) OR (intraoral scan) OR (digital impression) OR
      (scanbody) OR (virtual design) OR (digital design) OR (cad/cam) OR (rapid
      prototyping) OR (monolithic) OR (full-contour))} AND {(""Dental Technology"" [MeSH)
      OR ((conventional workflow) OR (lost-wax-technique) OR (porcelain-fused-to-metal)
      OR (PFM) OR (implant impression) OR (hand-layering) OR (veneering) OR
      (framework))} AND {((""Study, Feasibility"" [MeSH]) OR (""Survival"" [MeSH]) OR
      (""Success"" [MeSH]) OR (""Economics"" [MeSH]) OR (""Costs, Cost Analysis"" [MeSH]) OR 
      (""Esthetics, Dental"" [MeSH]) OR (""Patient Satisfaction"" [MeSH])) OR
      ((feasibility) OR (efficiency) OR (patient-centered outcome))}. Assessment of
      risk of bias in selected studies was done at a 'trial level' including random
      sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome
      data, selective reporting, and other bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. 
      A judgment of risk of bias was assigned if one or more key domains had a high or 
      unclear risk of bias. An official registration of the systematic review was not
      performed. RESULTS: The systematic search identified 67 titles, 32 abstracts
      thereof were screened, and subsequently, three full-texts included for data
      extraction. Analysed RCTs were heterogeneous without follow-up. One study
      demonstrated that fully digitally produced dental crowns revealed the feasibility
      of the process itself; however, the marginal precision was lower for lithium
      disilicate (LS2) restorations (113.8 mum) compared to conventional metal-ceramic 
      (92.4 mum) and zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) crowns (68.5 mum) (p < 0.05). Another
      study showed that leucite-reinforced glass ceramic crowns were esthetically
      favoured by the patients (8/2 crowns) and clinicians (7/3 crowns) (p < 0.05). The
      third study investigated implant crowns. The complete digital workflow was more
      than twofold faster (75.3 min) in comparison to the mixed analog-digital workflow
      (156.6 min) (p < 0.05). No RCTs could be found investigating multi-unit fixed
      dental prostheses (FDP). CONCLUSIONS: The number of RCTs testing complete digital
      workflows in fixed prosthodontics is low. Scientifically proven recommendations
      for clinical routine cannot be given at this time. Research with high-quality
      trials seems to be slower than the industrial progress of available digital
      applications. Future research with well-designed RCTs including follow-up
      observation is compellingly necessary in the field of complete digital
      processing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test whether or not pink veneering of the submucosal part of
      zirconia abutments influences clinical, microbiological and histological outcomes
      of cemented implant-supported single crowns (ISSC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      total of 20 patients with one single-tooth implant in the esthetic zone were
      included. Implants were randomly restored with either pink-veneered zirconia
      abutments (test group; n = 10) or non-veneered white zirconia abutments (control 
      group; n = 10) and with adhesively cemented all-ceramic crowns. At the 6-month
      follow-up, soft tissue biopsies were prepared for histological evaluation and
      microbiological samples were collected around abutments and the respective
      contra-lateral teeth (in 10 of 20 patients). One year after the initiation of
      loading, clinical parameters were assessed. Robust linear mixed model and
      cumulative linked mixed model analyses were performed to investigate the effect
      of group and time-point on clinical and biological outcomes. RESULTS: Clinical
      evaluations revealed stable peri-implant soft tissues in terms of probing pocket 
      depth, but a high BOP index (87.5% control; 80.0% test). No statistically
      significant differences were observed between the test and control group for any 
      outcome measure (P > 0.05). No major biological complications occurred during the
      observation period. Histological samples revealed a remarkable degree of
      inflammation in both groups without clear differences in qualitative histological
      features. Microbiological evaluation demonstrated a slightly higher bacterial
      count at implants compared to natural teeth at one year of loading without marked
      differences between groups. CONCLUSION: Limited by a small sample size and a
      relatively short observation period, pink-veneered zirconia abutments exhibited
      similar clinical, histological and microbiological outcomes as non-veneered
      zirconia abutments supporting cemented single crowns.

TI  - Complication and failure rates with implant-supported fixed dental prostheses and
      single crowns: a 10-year retrospective study.
PG  - 356-64
LID - 10.1111/cid.12066 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Clinical studies related to the long-term outcomes with
      implant-supported reconstructions are still sparse. The aim of this 10-year
      retrospective study was to assess the rate of mechanical/technical complications 
      and failures with implant supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) and single
      crowns (SCs) in a large cohort of partially edentulous patients. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The comprehensive multidisciplinary examination consisted of a
      medical/dental history, clinical examination, and a radiographic analysis.
      Prosthodontic examination evaluated the implant-supported reconstructions for
      mechanical/technical complications and failures, occlusal analysis,
      presence/absence of attrition, and location, extension, and retention type.
      RESULTS: Out of three hundred ninety seven fixed reconstructions in three hundred
      three patients, two hundred sixty eight were SCs and one hundred twenty seven
      were FDPs. Of these three hundred ninety seven implant-supported reconstructions,
      18 had failed, yielding a failure rate of 4.5% and a survival rate of 95.5% after
      a mean observation period of 10.75 years (range: 8.4-13.5 years). The most
      frequent complication was ceramic chipping (20.31%) followed by occlusal screw
      loosening (2.57%) and loss of retention (2.06%). No occlusal screw fracture, one 
      abutment loosening, and two abutment fractures were noted. This resulted in a
      total mechanical/technical complication rate of 24.7%. The prosthetic success
      rate over a mean follow-up time of 10.75 years was 70.8%. Generalized attrition
      and FDPs were associated with statistically significantly higher rates of ceramic
      fractures when compared with SCs. Cantilever extensions, screw retention,
      anterior versus posterior, and gender did not influence the chipping rate.
      CONCLUSIONS: After a mean exposure time of 10.75 years, high survival rates for
      reconstructions supported by Sand-blasted Large-grit Acid-etched implants can be 
      expected. Ceramic chipping was the most frequent complication and was increased
      in dentitions with attrition and in FDPs compared with SCs.

TI  - Monolithic lithium-disilicate single crowns supported by zirconia oral implants: 
      three-year results of a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1160-8
LID - 10.1111/clr.12716 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the survival and success rate of CAD/CAM-fabricated
      monolithic lithium-disilicate crowns supported by zirconia oral implants after 3 
      years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients in need of a single tooth
      replacement received a zirconia implant and were finally restored with 24 single 
      crowns (SCs) ground out of pre-crystallized lithium-disilicate blanks. The
      restorations were adhesively cemented and evaluated using modified United States 
      Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. In case of clinically relevant defects
      that could be repaired to an acceptable level, SCs were regarded as surviving.
      Restorations with minor chippings, a small-area roughness (o <2 mm), slightly
      soundable marginal gaps, minimal under-/overcontours, and tolerable color
      deviations (<1 Vitashade) were regarded as success. The Kaplan-Meier method and
      log-rank tests were used for the success/survival analyses and the calculation of
      potential group differences (gender, location, jaw). Additionally, several
      patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-three
      patients were seen 3 years after implant placement. No SC had to be replaced,
      resulting in 100% survival. No chippings were observed. As one SC showed a major 
      occlusal roughness, the Kaplan-Meier success rate after a mean observation period
      of 31 months was 95.7%. No group differences could be calculated. Compared with
      the pre-treatment surveys, the further PROMs showed a permanently improved
      perception of function, esthetics, sense, and speech. CONCLUSION: Monolithic
      lithium-disilicate SCs supported by zirconia implants showed promising survival
      and success rates after an observation period of 3 years. It remains to be seen
      whether the further observation period confirms this positive results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The authors aimed to compare the survival and complication rates of
      zirconia-ceramic (ZC) versus metal-ceramic (MC) restorative material in multiunit
      tooth-supported posterior fixed dental prostheses (FDP). TYPES OF STUDIES
      REVIEWED: The authors conducted a systematic search of randomized controlled
      trials (RCTs), with no time or language restrictions, up to May 2019 using the
      MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials databases, followed by a manual search. RESULTS: The authors
      included 7 RCTs in the review and 5 RCTs in the meta-analysis. All studies had a 
      low risk of bias. The authors included 330 participants (177 ZC and 173 MC
      tooth-supported FDP) in the meta-analysis, which revealed a medium-term survival 
      rate of 95.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.5% to 99.1%) for ZC FDP compared 
      with 96.9% (95% CI, 94.3% to 99.4%) for MC FDP, with no significant differences
      (P = .364). The biological or technical complications did not show statistically 
      significant differences, except in the global ceramic veneering chipping analysis
      (P = .023; risk difference [RD], 22.3%; 95% CI, 3.0% to 41.6%) and their
      subanalysis: minor chipping or chipping that can be solved with polishing (P =
      .044; RD, 19.5%; 95% CI, 0.5% to 38.4%), and major chipping or chipping that
      needs repair in the laboratory (P = .023; RD, 6.0%; 95% CI, 0.8% to 11.3%).
      CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Posterior multiunit ZC restorations are
      considered a predictable treatment in the medium term, although they are slightly
      more susceptible to chipping of the veneering ceramic than MC restorations.

TI  - Evaluation of zirconia-based posterior single crowns supported by zirconia
      implants: preliminary results of a prospective multicenter study.
PG  - 613-619
LID - 10.1111/clr.12842 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this uncontrolled prospective multicenter study was to
      determine the success and survival rate of posterior single crowns composed of
      zirconia frameworks hand-layered with a leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramic
      supported by one-piece zirconia oral implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In two
      centers, sixty patients received 71 zirconia oral implants. To obtain a clear
      indication of posterior implant-supported single crowns (ISSCs), 14 patients (25 
      implants) were excluded from the analysis (11 bridges, three anterior crowns).
      The remaining patients were provided with single implants in posterior regions.
      As one patient lost his implant and another refused further participation after
      final prosthesis insertion, 44 ISSCs/patients (19 females, 25 males) were
      available for evaluation. Of these patients, all were seen at prosthetic delivery
      and the 6- and 12-month follow-up appointments. Evaluations were performed using 
      modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Restorations
      within Alpha and Bravo ratings were regarded as success. This included minor
      chippings, a slight roughness, slightly soundable restoration margins and minimal
      contour deficiencies. In case of more distinct defects that could, however, be
      repaired to a clinically acceptable level, restorations were regarded as
      surviving. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were used for the
      success/survival analyses and the calculation of potential group differences
      (gender, jaw and center). RESULTS: After a mean observation period of 12.5 months
      (SD: 0.8 months), no ISSC had to be replaced, resulting in a Kaplan-Meier
      survival rate of 100%. The Kaplan-Meier success rate was 90.9% (one major
      chipping, one obvious roughness, one significant crevice and one pronounced
      over-contouring). Minor chippings and occlusal roughness were frequent
      complications. No significantly different survival/success rates could be
      observed between the mentioned groups. CONCLUSION: The frequent incidence of
      minor chippings suggests a high technique sensitivity when providing zirconia
      implants with veneered zirconia-based crowns questioning its suitability for this
      indication.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Studies reporting survival rates along with
      patient-centered outcomes are necessary to select the appropriate restorative
      material for crowns and fixed partial dentures (FPDs). However, studies that
      report the survival and complication rates of lithium disilicate crowns and the
      performance of zirconia FPDs compared with metal-ceramic FPDs are lacking.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical study was to assess the failure and
      complication incidence of tooth-supported ceramic crowns and FPDs in function for
      at least 5 years. Groups included were pressed lithium disilicate crowns (CP),
      veneered pressed lithium disilicate crowns (CV), and computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) lithium disilicate crowns (CC). Veneered
      zirconia-based FPDs (FPDC) were compared with metal-ceramic FPDs (FPDM). Outcomes
      were survival and failure, success and complications, periodontal conditions, and
      patient satisfaction assessed at 2 examinations (at baseline >/=1 year after
      delivery and at the follow-up examination >/=5 years of function). MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Eighty-two participants with 158 restorations (CP=39, CV=16, CC=20,
      FPDM=30, FPDC=53) were examined (2.38 +/-0.96 years after delivery) to form the
      baseline data. For the prospective follow-up examination, 70 participants with
      141 restorations (CP=39, CV=15, CC=16, FPDM=28, FPDC=43) were examined 4.08
      +/-0.36 years later. RESULTS: At the follow-up, restorations were in function for
      a mean of 6.44 +/-1.14 years. Survival rates for crowns were 97.1% (CP=97.4%,
      CV=100%, and CC=93.8%) and 98.6% for FPDs (FPDM=96.4%, FPDC=100%). Among the 68
      crowns, 1 technical and 4 biological complications were recorded. FPDs had more
      biological and technical complications than crowns (15/149 abutment teeth and
      11/71 restorations). Technical complications were seen in 9.3% of zirconia FPDs
      compared with 25% for metal-ceramic FPDs. Complications were commonly observed at
      the baseline examination (crowns: 12/75 biological and 1/75 technical; FPDs:
      40/174 abutment teeth with biological and 8/83 FPDs with technical
      complications). The periodontal conditions improved significantly after baseline.
      The patients reported a high level of satisfaction with the esthetics and
      function of the crowns and FPDs. CONCLUSIONS: Survival rate for ceramic crowns
      and FPDs was 97.9% after a mean observation time of 6.44 +/-1.14 years.
      Biological complications were more commonly observed than technical
      complications, and complications were more common in FPDs than in crowns. The
      complication rate was similar for zirconia FPDs and metal-ceramic FPDs. Adherence
      to strict maintenance measures may have reduced the risk of biological
      complications.

      maxillary right central incisor were fabricated of Ti and zirconia (n = 30 of
      each) for an internal-connection implant system. All-ceramic crowns were
      fabricated using the following systems (n = 10 per group): monolithic with
      computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) lithium disilicate 
      (MLD), pressed lithium disilicate (PLD), or CAD yttrium-stabilized tetragonal
      zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP). The frameworks of the PLD and Y-TZP systems were
      manually veneered with a fluorapatite-based ceramic. The crowns were cemented to 
      their implant abutments, and the absolute marginal discrepancy of the gap was
      measured before and after cementation. Data were analyzed statistically. RESULTS:
      Marginal discrepancies were significantly influenced by the crown system and by
      cementation, but the material did not significantly affect the results.
      Interaction terms were not significant. Y-TZP crowns on both Ti and zirconia
      abutments presented the smallest mean marginal discrepancies before (52.1 +/- 17 
      mum and 56.2 +/- 11 mum, respectively) and after cementation (98.7 +/- 17 mum and
      101.8 +/- 16 mum, respectively). Before cementation, MLD crowns showed
      significantly larger mean marginal openings than PLD crowns on both Ti and
      zirconia abutments (75.2 +/- 12 and 77.5 +/- 13 mum for MLD, 52.1 +/- 17 mum and 
      69.7 +/- 8 mum for PLD, respectively). After cementation, both Ti and zirconia
      abutments with MLD crowns (113.5 +/- 12 mum and 118.3 +/- 14 mum, respectively)
      showed significantly larger values than with PLD crowns (98.7 +/- 17 mum and
      109.4 +/- 9 mum, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Manually veneered Y-TZP crowns
      demonstrated more favorable marginal fit on both Ti and zirconia implant
      abutments before and after cementation compared to those of MLD and PLD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this analysis was to assess and compare the 5- and
      10-year survival of different types of tooth-supported and implant-supported
      fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) and single crowns (SCs), and to describe the
      incidence of biological and technical complications with emphasis on quality of
      reporting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis was based on six systematic review 
      identifying prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case-series on FDPs 
      and SCs with a mean follow-up time of at least 5 years. Patients had to have been
      examined clinically at the follow-up visit. Failure and complication rates were
      analysed using random-effects Poisson regression models to obtain summary
      estimates of 5- and 10-year survival proportions. RESULTS: Meta-analyses of the
      included studies indicated that the 5-year survival rates ranged from 89.2% to
      95.5% for different types of restorations. Investigating the relative failure
      rates using implant-supported SCs as reference, conventional and cantilever
      tooth-supported FDPs and resin-bonded prosthesis (RBPs) showed higher failure
      rates. Moreover, for RBPs, this difference reached statistical significance (p = 
      0.018). Analysing the studies with 10 years follow-up time, the survival ranged
      from 65% to 89.4%. After a 10-year observation period, the lowest annual failure 
      rates were seen for implant-supported SCs (1.12%), conventional tooth-supported
      FDPs (1.14%) and implant-supported FDPs (1.43%). Cantilever tooth-supported FDPs,
      combined tooth-implant-supported FDPs and RBPs had significantly (p < 0.001)
      higher annual failure rates of 2.20%, 2.51% and 4.31%, respectively. According to
      presently recommended standards for reporting cohort studies (STROBE Statement), 
      it was evident that the included studies did not fulfil the present standards to 
      a great extent. Information on study design, methods of selecting study
      participants, percentage and reason for participants lost to follow-up was often 
      not reported. Furthermore, the included studies rarely discussed possible
      limitations and potential sources of bias. Moreover, funding sources were
      generally not reported. CONCLUSION: Based on the present analysis treatment
      planning in a mutilated dentition in need of oral reconstructions should base on 
      the results of the systematic reviews performed. In this context, the choice of
      reconstructions on teeth with end abutments, of reconstructions on implants (both
      FDPs and SCs) should be given first priority, while combined
      tooth-implant-supported reconstructions, cantilever reconstructions on teeth and 
      RBPs represent options of second priority. Future studies on performance of
      implant-supported restorations should be prospective in design and should follow 
      the present recommendation for reporting cohort studies (The STROBE statement).

TI  - Fracture Strength of Zirconia and Alumina Ceramic Crowns Supported by Implants.
PG  - 352-9
LID - 10.1563/AAID-JOI-D-13-00142 [doi]
AB  - Due to the brittleness and limited tensile strength of the veneering
      glass-ceramic materials, the methods that combine strong core material (as
      zirconia or alumina) are still under debate. The present study aims to evaluate
      the fracture strength and the mechanism of failure through fractographic analysis
      of single all-ceramic crowns supported by implants. Forty premolar cores were
      fabricated with CAD/CAM technology using alumina (n = 20) and zirconia (n = 20). 
      The specimens were veneered with glass-ceramic, cemented on titanium abutments,
      and subjected to loading test until fracture. SEM fractographic analysis was also
      performed. The fracture load was 1165 (+/-509) N for alumina and 1638 (+/-662) N 
      for zirconia with a statistically significant difference between the two groups
      (P = 0.026). Fractographic analysis of alumina-glass-ceramic crowns, showed the
      presence of catastrophic cracks through the entire thickness of the alumina core;
      for the zirconia-glass-ceramic crowns, the cracks involved mainly the thickness
      of the ceramic veneering layer. The sandblast procedure of the zirconia core
      influenced crack path deflection. Few samples (n = 3) showed limited microcracks 
      of the zirconia core. Zirconia showed a significantly higher fracture strength
      value in implant-supported restorations, indicating the role played by the high
      resistant cores for premolar crowns.

TI  - Fracture rate of 188695 lithium disilicate and zirconia ceramic restorations
      after up to 7.5 years of clinical service: A dental laboratory survey.
PG  - 807-810

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The use of ceramic materials has increased significantly
      because of high esthetic demands, low costs, and ease of fabrication. Long-term, 
      clinically based evidence is scarce, and laboratory studies have limited
      relevance in determining clinical durability. PURPOSE: The purpose of this dental
      laboratory survey was to evaluate the fracture rate of layered and monolithic
      lithium disilicate and zirconia single crowns and fixed partial dentures after up
      to 7.5 years of clinical service. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two commercial dental
      laboratories with a database system that was able to track the number of remakes 
      because of fracture only were identified. Lithium disilicate restorations
      (monolithic and layered) were categorized according to restoration type (single
      crown, fixed partial denture, veneer, and onlay). Zirconia restorations
      (monolithic and layered) were categorized according to type (single crown, fixed 
      partial denture) and then into anterior or posterior restoration. Restoration
      remakes due to poor fit, shade, or marginal integrity were excluded from the
      evaluation. Data were analyzed, and statistical significance was evaluated with
      chi-square tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: A total of 188 695 (51 751 lithium
      disilicate and 136 944 zirconia) restorations were included in the analysis, with
      an overall fracture rate of 1.35%. Lithium disilicate monolithic single crowns
      had a fracture rate of 0.96%, which was significantly lower than that of layered 
      single crowns at 1.26% (P<.05). When the different types of lithium disilicate
      restorations were compared, fixed partial denture (monolithic and layered)
      fracture rates were significantly higher than those of single crowns (P<.001).
      Monolithic zirconia single crowns (0.54%) fractured at a lower rate than layered 
      zirconia single crowns (2.83%) and monolithic fixed partial dentures (1.83%)
      (P<.001), while layered single crowns (2.83%) had a higher fracture rate than
      that of layered fixed partial dentures (1.93%) (P<.001). Monolithic anterior and 
      posterior zirconia restorations fractured at a lower rate than layered anterior
      and posterior zirconia restorations (P<.05). Posterior monolithic zirconia
      restorations fractured at a lower rate than anterior restorations, while
      posterior layered zirconia restorations fractured at a higher rate than anterior 
      zirconia restorations (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the 7.5-year period,
      restorations fabricated with lithium disilicate and zirconia restorations had
      relatively low fracture rates. Monolithic restorations fractured at a lower rate 
      than layered restorations.

TI  - Fracture Resistance of Straight and Angulated Zirconia Implant Abutments
      Supporting Anterior Three-Unit Lithium Disilicate Fixed Dental Prostheses.
PG  - 1240-1246
LID - 10.11607/jomi.4131 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate fracture resistance of
      straight and angulated zirconia implant abutments supporting anterior three-unit 
      lithium disilicate fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four
      different test groups (n = 8) representing anterior three-unit implant-supported 
      all-ceramic FDPs were fabricated to fit an in vitro model with two implants.
      Groups 1 and 2 simulated a clinical situation with an ideal implant position for 
      maxillary left central and right lateral incisors from a prosthetic point of
      view, which allowed for the use of a straight, prefabricated zirconia and
      titanium abutment. Groups 3 and 4 simulated a situation with a compromised
      implant position that required an angulated (15-degree) abutment. Tapered
      internal-connection implants (Direct's Legacy, 13-mm length, 3.7-mm diameter,
      Implant Direct) mounted in epoxy resin models were used in this study. Lithium
      disilicate (IPS e.max press, Ivoclar Vivadent) three-unit FDPs were fabricated
      and cemented using self-adhesive resin cement. The samples were subjected to
      thermocycling (2 x 3,000 x 5 degrees C/55 degrees C) and mechanical loading
      (TCML; 50 N x 600,000 cycles). Fracture resistances were determined for all the
      samples that survived aging. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney
      U tests were performed to test for differences in fracture strength values at a
      5% significance level. RESULTS: All samples subjected to TCML survived without
      mechanical failure. The highest fracture loads were associated with FDPs
      supported by implants with 0-degree abutment angulations compared with those FDPs
      supported by 15-degree abutment angulations (group 1: 538.7 +/- 24.77 N; group 2:
      542.17 +/- 21.64 N; group 3: 523.57 +/- 19.71 N; group 4: 528.37 +/- 24.57 N).
      This difference in load-bearing capacity was not statistically significant (P >
      .05). CONCLUSION: The use of angulated zirconia abutments for compensation of
      nonideal implant locations is possible without reducing the load-bearing capacity
      of implant-supported anterior three-unit lithium disilicate FDPs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study's hypothesis was to evaluate differences of the occlusal
      wear rate for monolithically fabricated lithium disilicate and hand-veneered
      zirconia crowns in-vivo. Furthermore, a comparison of the materials' clinical
      performance according to CDA criteria was investigated. METHODS: A total number
      of 15 patients in the need of full-coverage ceramic fixed dental prosthesis on
      molars were treated with two crowns each (n=30), randomly assigned on the
      contralateral sides made of monolithic IPS e.max CAD (n=15) and IPS e.max Ceram
      hand-veneered zirconia (n=15). Clinical examination was conducted, silicone
      impressions were taken and plaster models fabricated at the day of crown
      insertion (baseline) and after 1, 2 and 3 years. The abrasion rate was digitally 
      investigated: after model digitization with the industrial scanner Atos II, each 
      follow-up model was superimposed with the baseline model. The wear was evaluated 
      as the difference between two scans in terms of maximum vertical loss [mm],
      average decrease [mm] and volume loss [mm(3)]. For statistical analysis, the
      Mann-Whitney U test was performed and significance was set to less than 0.05.
      RESULTS: IPS e.max CAD crowns showed a volume loss of -0.68mm(3) after three
      years, while IPS e.max Ceram hand-veneered zirconia crowns showed a volumetric
      wear of -0.75mm(3) at the same point of time. However, no significant differences
      were found between both materials regarding the 3 evaluated wear parameters. The 
      survival rate for both materials was 100 % and the clinical performance outcome
      was good to excellent. CONCLUSION: The two investigated materials for ceramic
      fixed dental prostheses showed similar wear rates and clinical performance over
      an in-vivo use of 3 years. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Ceramic restorations are
      subject to occlusal wear over time due to the natural masticatory process. Both
      monolithic lithium disilicate and glass-ceramic veneered zirconia copings showed 
      clinically satisfactory results over 3 years in-situ. In terms of abrasion, they 
      are equally well suited for clinical use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the various events occurring 
      in unsplinted implant restoration in posterior jaws during a period of 4 years.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: From August 2008 to April 2009, eight volunteers (three
      men and five women) who had two or more consecutively missing teeth received 20
      implants in posterior maxillae and mandibles. Unsplinted single crowns were
      delivered to each implant. For the 4-year follow-up periods, patients were
      enrolled in a maintenance schedule at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. The
      data, including a questionnaire, radiography, mobility and probing were recorded 
      on regular check-ups. RESULTS: A total of 20 implants in eight patients were
      followed up for 48 months, showing a 100% survival rate. Mean marginal bone loss 
      around implants was 0.26 mm. Statistical analysis revealed insignificant
      correlation between metal-ceramic and zirconia-ceramic crowns and among implant
      lengths (8.5 mm, 10 mm and 11.5 mm). Mean probing depths were similar or
      insignificantly different, regardless of the materials used or length of
      implants. The most frequent complications, in decreasing order, were food
      impaction (65%) and porcelain chipping (45%), sensitivity (25%), pain (20%) and
      loose contact (15%). Compared with metal-ceramic crowns, zirconia-ceramic crowns 
      showed more unfavorable cases of porcelain chipping (p=0.017), pain (p=0.007) and
      loose contact with an adjacent crown (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of
      the sample size, this study showed that unsplinted implant-supported single
      restorations to replace consecutive posterior missing teeth may function well.

TI  - Which mechanical and physical testing methods are relevant for predicting the
      clinical performance of ceramic-based dental prostheses?
PG  - 218-31
AB  - PURPOSE: The survival and performance of clinical prostheses with a ceramic
      component are probabilistic in nature. Only under very rare circumstances will
      all of the prostheses in a group exhibit either 100% successes or 100% failures
      over a period of 5 years or more. Prosthesis failure may be defined as any
      condition that leads to replacement. These conditions include secondary caries,
      irreversible pulpitis, excessive wear of opposing tooth surfaces, excessive
      erosion and roughening of the ceramic surface, ditching of the cement margin,
      unacceptable esthetics, cracking, chipping and fracture. A systematic review of
      the dental literature was performed to determine the extent to which the
      mechanical and physical properties of dental alloys and ceramics can predict the 
      5-year clinical performance of metal-ceramic and all-ceramic fixed dental
      prostheses (FDP) and to determine the associated quality of reported outcomes
      associated with these clinical studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The review was
      based on clinical research studies of 5 years or greater duration that were
      published in English dental journals between 1980 and 2006 using the following
      key words and MeSH terms. Our search strategy was as follows: Search 1: Partial
      fixed denture OR denture, partial, fixed OR denture, partial fixed OR dental
      porcelain OR metal ceramic alloys OR dental ceramic Search 2: Prosthesis failure 
      OR dental restoration failure OR time factors OR survival analysis Search 3:
      Meta-analysis OR evaluation studies OR review OR clinical trial OR comparative
      study OR follow-up studies OR prospective studies OR clinical follow-up study OR 
      clinical trial OR longitudinal studies Inclusion of searches 1, 2 and 3 and
      limits placed on the publication date starting on January 1, 1980, English
      language, and clinical studies involving humans resulted in a total of 684
      articles. By restricting the clinical studies to 5 years or more in duration, the
      number was reduced to 193. By eliminating resin-bonded FDPs, cantilever designs, 
      implant-supported prostheses, crowns, inlay- or onlay-supported prostheses, a
      total of 37 articles remained for detailed review. After excluding review
      articles and articles involving resin-bonded bridges, single-author clinical
      research articles, cantilever designs and implant-supported FDPs, 11 clinical
      research articles remained. For these articles, it was not possible to determine 
      conclusively the probability of failure for three-unit FDPs compared with
      four-unit and larger prostheses or the location of the crowns and pontics.
      RESULTS: This systematic review of studies on ceramic-based FDPs confirms the
      results of previous studies that, in most cases, less than 15% of these
      prostheses were removed or were in need of replacement at 10 years. However,
      there was considerable variability in the number of parameters that were reported
      as well as the range of details on failures that occurred. In some studies, a
      standardized evaluation system was used in which USPHS or Ryge criteria were
      applied. However, there was also great uncertainty in the definition of failure
      with respect to repairable fractures and whether the identified causative factors
      were directly or indirectly associated with the replacement of the prostheses.
      CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that there is no single in vitro test variable
      that can predict clinical performance in these prostheses. Based on these
      reviews, there is an urgent need to develop a comprehensive classification system
      for identifying clinical prosthesis failures, technical complications and
      biologic complications. Guidelines on the retrieval of fractured prostheses
      and/or impressions that capture the fracture surface details should also be
      developed. The predictive power of in vitro data can be increased by finite
      element stress analysis and computer programs such as the CARES/Life software
      (NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH) that estimates the time-dependent
      nature of ceramic structure survival.

PG  - 48-54

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the internationally
      published survival and complication rates of implant-supported computer-aided
      designing (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)-fabricated restorations
      and to compare them with those of conventionally fabricated implant-supported
      restorations. METHODS: An electronic MEDLINE search was conducted to identify
      prospective and retrospective cohort studies on CAD-CAM fabricated
      implant-supported restorations with a mean follow-up time of at least 1 year.
      Failure and complication rates were evaluated and descriptive statistics were
      performed. RESULTS: An electronic MEDLINE search revealed four studies reporting 
      on implant-supported CAD-CAM fabricated restorations. The cumulative 5-year
      survival rate of implants supporting full-arch-fixed dental prostheses (FDPs)
      ranged from 81.4% to 95.6%. Reported survival rates of implants supporting
      all-ceramic single crowns (SCs) were 100% [95% confidence interval (CI):
      92.4-100]. The cumulative 5-year survival rate for full-arch FDPs ranged from
      72.2% to 100%. Reported cumulative 5-year survival rates for all-ceramic SCs were
      100% (95% CI: 92.4-100%). Technical complications were reported in two of the
      four selected studies and the estimated annual failure rate for chipping/fracture
      of the veneering material was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.06-3.06) for implant-supported
      all-ceramic SCs and 3.61 (95% CI: 2.05-6.36) for implant-supported FDPs.
      CONCLUSIONS: Only a small number of clinical studies reporting on
      implant-supported CAD-CAM fabricated restorations exists which makes a
      scientifically valid comparison with conventionally fabricated restorations
      impossible.

TI  - [Clinical performance of chairside monolithic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic
      CAD-CAM crowns].
PG  - 191-195
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical performance of chairside monolithic lithium 
      disilicate glass-ceramics computer-aided design(CAD)-computer aided
      manufacturing(CAM) crowns, and to analyze the influencing factors of cumulative
      survival rate. METHODS: Two hundred and fourteen patients who had chairside
      posterior lithium disilicate glass-ceramic CAD-CAM crowns in Peking University
      Shenzhen Hospital from March 2015 to March 2017 were enrolled. The crown
      preparations were milled using Cerec Omnicam system. The clinical and esthetic
      effects of the crowns were analyzed at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. The
      cumulative survival rate of crowns was calculated, and the effects of gender,
      age, pulp condition, tooth position and adhesive type on the cumulative survival 
      rate were analyzed. SPSS 20.0 software package was used for statistical analysis.
      RESULTS: After a 36-month follow-up, the failed crowns were mainly caused by
      marginal integrity, crown fracture and loss of retention. During the observation 
      period of 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months, the scores of color, shape, quality of
      proximal contact, and chewing ability were greater than 9. The cumulative
      survival rates were 100.00%, 96.17%, 94.89%, 92.77% and 91.06% at 3, 6, 12, 24
      and 36 months, respectively. The cumulative survival rate had no significant
      difference among different gender, age, and dental pulp status(P>0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Chairside monolithic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic CAD-CAM crowns
      have a high 3-year cumulative survival rate and good esthetic outcome, which is
      not affected by gender, age, and pulp status with high clinical value.

AB  - During the past decade, zirconia-based ceramics have been successfully introduced
      into the clinic to fabricate fixed dental prostheses (FDPs), along with a dental 
      computer-aided/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system. In this article (1)
      development of dental ceramics, (2) the current status of dental CAD/CAM systems,
      (3) CAD/CAM and zirconia restoration, (4) bond between zirconia and veneering
      ceramics, (5) bond of zirconia with resin-based luting agents, (6) surface finish
      of zirconia restoration and antagonist enamel wear, and (7) clinical evaluation
      of zirconia restoration are reviewed. Yttria partially stabilized tetragonal
      zirconia polycrystalline (Y-TZP) showed better mechanical properties and superior
      resistance to fracture than other conventional dental ceramics. Furthermore,
      ceria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline and alumina nanocomposites
      (Ce-TZP/A) had the highest fracture toughness and had resistance to
      low-temperature aging degradation. Both zirconia-based ceramics have been
      clinically available as an alternative to the metal framework for fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs). Marginal adaptation of zirconia-based FDPs is acceptable for
      clinical application. The most frequent clinical complication with zirconia-based
      FDPs was chipping of the veneering porcelain that was affected by many factors.
      The mechanism for the bonding between zirconia and veneering ceramics remains
      unknown. There was no clear evidence of chemical bonding and the bond strength
      between zirconia and porcelain was lower than that between metal and porcelain.
      There were two alternatives proposed that might avoid chipping of veneering
      porcelains. One was hybrid-structured FDPs comprising CAD/CAM-fabricated
      porcelain parts adhering to a CAD/CAM fabricated zirconia framework. Another
      option was full-contour zirconia FDPs using high translucent zirconia. Combined
      application of silica coating and/or silane coupler, and 10-methacryloyloxydecyl 
      dihydrogen phosphate is currently one of the most reliable bonding systems for
      zirconia. Adhesive treatments could be applied to luting the restorations and
      fabricating hybrid-structured FDPs. Full-contour zirconia FDPs caused concern
      about the wear of antagonist enamel, because the hardness of Y-TZP was over
      double that of porcelain. However, this review demonstrates that highly polished 
      zirconia yielded lower antagonist wear compared with porcelains. Polishing of
      zirconia is possible, but glazing is not recommended for the surface finish of
      zirconia. Clinical data since 2010 are included in this review. The zirconia
      frameworks rarely got damaged in many cases and complications often occurred in
      the veneering ceramic materials. Further clinical studies with larger sample
      sizes and longer follow-up periods are required to investigate the possible
      influencing factors of technical failures.

      fracture behaviour.
PG  - 9-84
AB  - Loss of teeth can affect a person's appearance and functions such as eating and
      speaking. There is thus a need for prosthetic rehabilitation to improve quality
      of life. For many patients, a fixed dental restoration is preferred, and a common
      restoration is a porcelain-fused-to-metal bridge retained by teeth or implants.
      Metal-based restorations can potentially cause adverse reactions though, and this
      is cause for the search for alternative materials. All-ceramic materials are
      characterized by strong atomic bonds that make them reluctant to react with the
      environment, and thus unlikely to cause adverse reactions. All-ceramic materials 
      have other attractive material properties and excellent aesthetic properties and 
      have been successfully used in dentistry, mostly for smaller anterior
      restorations. Ceramics, however, do not withstand tensile forces as well as
      metals, and are susceptible to brittle fractures with the connector area being
      especially prone to fracture. More recently, a new type of ceramic material,
      based on zirconium dioxide, has been developed. Yttria-stabilized tetragonal
      zirconia polycrystal, Y-TZP, has a unique ability to resist crack propagation by 
      being able to transform from one crystalline phase to another, and the resultant 
      volume increase stops the crack and prevents it from propagating. This material
      has the potential to be used for larger restorations and in the molar area. Not
      enough information, however, is available on clinical follow-up of zirconia-based
      restorations, especially long-term, and information about all-ceramic
      restorations supported by implants is lacking. The aim of this thesis was to
      evaluate designs of zirconia-based restorations in relation to achieving
      increased fracture resistance and evaluate the clinical performance of
      implant-supported zirconia-based restorations. In paper I implant-supported
      all-ceramic fixed partial dentures of two different ceramic materials were
      compared; a zirconia-toughened alumina material (group 1) and a fully-sintered
      Y-TZP material (group 2). Eighteen patients were randomly divided between the two
      groups. At the one-year follow-up, all restorations were in function and no
      complete fractures were noted. However, fractures of the veneering material were 
      noted. There was a significant difference between the two materials: 54% of the
      restorations in group 2 showed veneer fractures compared to 8% of the
      restorations in group 1. Paper IV is a five-year follow-up of the same patient
      groups. All restorations were still in function without complete fractures, but
      an increase in veneer fractures was noted: 69% of the restorations in group 2
      showed veneer fractures compared to 17% in group 1. In paper II the fracture
      strength was evaluated for 4-unit Y-TZP fixed dental prosthesis frameworks with
      different connector dimensions: 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 mm. The results showed
      a significant increase in load at fracture for each increase in connector
      diameter and recommendations for clinically relevant connector dimensions were
      suggested. In paper III implant-supported Y-TZP fixed full-arch mandibular
      dentures were evaluated. At the three-year follow-up all restorations were in
      function and no complete fractures were noted. However, fractures of the
      veneering material were noted in nine of the ten patients, affecting 34% of the
      units. In paper V the fracture strength of crowns with different types of Y-TZP
      core materials and different core design and different veneering materials was
      evaluated. The crowns were cemented onto tooth-like abutments, except for one
      group cemented onto implant-like titanium abutments. The results showed
      significantly higher loads at fracture and less severe veneer fractures for
      crowns with anatomically shaped cores compared to simple cores of even thickness.
      Crowns supported by implant-like titanium abutments showed significantly higher
      loads at fracture than did those supported by tooth-like abutments. The type of
      core-material and veneering material did not influence the results.

TI  - Three-year analysis of zirconia implants used for single-tooth replacement and
      three-unit fixed dental prostheses: A prospective multicenter study.
PG  - 290-299
LID - 10.1111/clr.13115 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate clinically and
      radiographically the outcome of zirconia oral implants after 3 years in function.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 60 patients in need of either a single-tooth
      replacement or a three-unit fixed dental prosthesis (FDP), a total of 71
      one-piece zirconia implants were placed and immediately restored with temporary
      fixed prostheses. After a period of at least 2 months in the mandible and at
      least 4 months in the maxilla, zirconia-based reconstructions were cemented. The 
      implants were clinically and radiologically examined at implant insertion,
      prosthetic delivery, at 6 months and then yearly up to 3 years. A linear mixed
      model was used to analyze statistically the influence of prognostic factors on
      changes in the marginal bone level. RESULTS: Seventy-one implants (48 in the
      mandible, 23 in the maxilla) inserted in 60 patients were restored with 49 crowns
      and 11 FDP. One patient lost his implant after 5 weeks. Five patients with one
      implant each could not be evaluated after 3 years. Based on 55 patients with a
      total of 66 implants, the mean survival rate was 98.5% after 3 years in function.
      A statistically significant mean marginal bone loss (0.70 mm +/- 0.72 mm) has
      been detected from implant insertion to the 3-year follow-up. The largest
      marginal bone loss occurred between implantation and prosthetic delivery (0.67 mm
      +/- 0.56 mm). After delivery, no statistically significant bone level change was 
      observed (0.02 mm +/- 0.59 mm). None of the investigated prognostic factors had a
      significant influence on changes in the marginal bone level. CONCLUSIONS: After 3
      years in function, the investigated one-piece zirconia implant showed a high
      survival rate and a low marginal bone loss. The implant system was successful for
      single-tooth replacement and three-unit FDPs. Further investigations with
      long-term data are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective clinical study was to assess the
      long-term clinical survival rate and the technical and biological complication
      rates of zirconia-based posterior FDPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five
      patients in need of one or more posterior FDPs received 57 three- to five-unit
      zirconia-based FDPs. The frameworks were fabricated by means of a prototype
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system (direct ceramic machining, DCM), first 
      processing zirconia in the white stage. The frameworks were veneered with a
      prototype veneering ceramic.The FDPs were adhesively placed. At baseline, 6
      months, and 1,2, 3, 5, 8 and 10 years of function, the FDPs were examined for
      technical and/or biological complications. Furthermore, the periodontal health of
      the abutment teeth (test) and untreated control teeth was analyzed. Statistical
      analysis was performed applying descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival and
      multiple mixed effects regression tests. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with 26
      FDPs were examined at a mean observation time of 10.7 +/- 1.3 years. A total of
      16 FDPs were lost to follow-up. Fifteen FDPs had to be replaced due to
      technical/biological complications; hence, the 10-year survival rate of the FDPs 
      was 67%. Three framework fractures occurred, resulting in a 10-year survival rate
      for the zirconia frameworks of 91.5%. Chipping/fracture of the veneering ceramic 
      was detected in 16 FDPs over 10 years (complication rate 32%). A significant
      correlation of the span of the FDPs and the incidence of chipping was observed:
      4- and 5-unit FDPs had a 4.9 times higher probability for chipping than 3-unit
      FDPs. Marginal discrepancy/degradation was found in 90.7% of the FDPs over 10
      years. At 11 of the FDPs (complication rate 27%), secondary caries occurred. No
      difference of the periodontal health was found around test and control teeth.
      CONCLUSION: The zirconia frameworks exhibited very good long-term stability.
      However, the zirconia-based FDPs frequently exhibited problems such as marginal
      deficiency or chipping of the veneering ceramic. Both problems may be associated 
      with the prototype status of the system.

TI  - Survival of zirconia- and metal-supported fixed dental prostheses: a systematic
      review.
PG  - 493-502
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate and compare the
      frequency of veneer chipping and core fracture of zirconia fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) and porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) FDPs and determine possible 
      influencing factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SCOPUS database and International
      Association of Dental Research abstracts were searched for clinical studies
      involving zirconia and PFM FDPs. Furthermore, studies that were integrated into
      systematic reviews on PFM FDPs were also evaluated. The principle investigators
      of any clinical studies on zirconia FDPs were contacted to provide additional
      information. Based on the available information for each FDP, a data file was
      constructed. Veneer chipping was divided into three grades (grade 1 = polishing, 
      grade 2 = repair, grade 3 = replacement). To assess the frequency of veneer
      chipping and possible influencing factors, a piecewise exponential model was used
      to adjust for a study effect. RESULTS: None of the studies on PFM FDPs (reviews
      and additional searching) sufficiently satisfied the criteria of this review to
      be included. Thirteen clinical studies on zirconia FDPs and two studies that
      investigated both zirconia and PFM FDPs were identified. These studies involved
      664 zirconia and 134 PFM FDPs at baseline. Follow-up data were available for 595 
      zirconia and 127 PFM FDPs. The mean observation period was approximately 3 years 
      for both groups. The frequency of core fracture was less than 1% in the zirconia 
      group and 0% in the PFM group. When all studies were included, 142 veneer
      chippings were recorded for zirconia FDPs (24%) and 43 for PFM FDPs (34%).
      However, the studies differed extensively with regard to veneer chipping of
      zirconia: 85% of all chippings occurred in 4 studies, and 43% of all chippings
      included zirconia FDPs. If only studies that evaluated both types of core
      materials were included, the frequency of chipping was 54% for the
      zirconia-supported FDPs and 34% for PFM FDPs. When adjusting the survival rate
      for the study effect, the difference between zirconia and PFM FDPs was
      statistically significant for all grades of chippings (P = .001), as well as for 
      chipping grade 3 (P = .02). If all grades of veneer chippings were taken into
      account, the survival of PFM FDPs was 97%, while the survival rate of the
      zirconia FDPs was 90% after 3 years for a typical study. For both PFM and
      zirconia FDPs, the frequency of grades 1 and 2 veneer chippings was considerably 
      higher than grade 3. Veneer chipping was significantly less frequent in pressed
      materials than in hand-layered materials, both for zirconia and PFM FDPs (P =
      .04). CONCLUSIONS: Since the frequency of veneer chipping was significantly
      higher in the zirconia FDPs than PFM FDPs, and as refined processing procedures
      have started to yield better results in the laboratory, new clinical studies with
      these new procedures must confirm whether the frequency of veneer chipping can be
      reduced to the level of PFM.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of monolithic zirconia in
      function and minimally veneered zirconia (feldspathic ceramic, not in function,
      on the facial surface to enhance tooth esthetics or replace gingival structures) 
      on both teeth and implants. This open-ended consecutive case series involved 238 
      patients between the ages of 16 and 92 years, 1,022 restoration units, and 365
      cases in all categories of tooth and implant restorations in a private practice
      clinical environment for up to 68 months. The restoration parameters monitored in
      the patient base were fracture, cracking, or chipping of the zirconia structure
      and/or the minimally veneered feldspathic ceramic. There were no observed
      complications with respect to these parameters associated with any of the
      restorations included in this study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the
      clinical performance of veneered anatomically designed zirconia fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) resulting from intraoral digital impressions. METHODS: 24
      patients requiring treatment were provided with all-ceramic FDPs. Intraoral scans
      (iTero) were performed and veneered anatomically designed CAD/CAM-zirconia FDPs
      (Zerion/VitaVM9) were fabricated. A feldspar veneering ceramic following a slow
      cooling firing protocol was applied. A self-curing resin based luting material
      was used for adhesive cementation. Clinical evaluations were performed at
      baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months recalls according to the modified
      USPHS-criteria. Intraoral digital surface scans (iTero) were performed at each
      recall examination and were digitally superimposed (Geomagic) to evaluate
      potential veneer cohesive fractures. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis comprised
      secondary caries, clinically unacceptable fractures, root canal treatment and
      debonding. Kaplan-Meier success rate included restorations with minimal crevices,
      tolerable color deviations and clinically acceptable fractures. Data were
      statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival rate and success rate 
      of the FDPs were 100% and 91.7%, respectively. Clinically acceptable veneer
      cohesive fractures and crevices at the restoration margin were observed in two
      patients. These shallow veneer fractures were only detected by overlapping
      baseline and recall scans. Ceramic surface roughness increased significantly over
      time (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Veneered zirconia FDPs fabricated from digital
      intraoral scans showed a favorable clinical performance over an observation
      period of 18 months. Anatomical zirconia core design and slow cooling firing
      protocol of the veneering ceramic reduced the incidence of chip fractures to a
      level that could not be detected clinically. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The digital
      workflow on the basis of intraoral digital impressions resulted in clinically
      satisfying outcomes for veneered zirconia FDPs.

TI  - Fracture Resistance of Monolithic Glass-Ceramics Versus Bilayered Zirconia-Based 
      Restorations.
PG  - e259-e264
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12684 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the fracture resistance of monolithic reinforced
      glass-ceramic restorations with bilayer zirconia-based restorations. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Fifteen ceramic crowns were fabricated on epoxy dies duplicated from
      a stainless steel master die. They were divided into 3 equal groups (n = 5)
      according to the type of ceramic material used: group I, monolithic lithium
      disilicate (IPS e.max CAD), group V, monolithic zirconia-reinforced lithium
      silicate (Vita Suprinity), and group B (bilayered zirconia substructure with
      veneering ceramic). All specimens were cemented on epoxy dies with a
      self-adhesive resin cement (Rely X Unicem), subjected to a chewing simulator, and
      then loaded until fracture in a universal testing machine. The results were
      tabulated and statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA to compare among the 3
      materials. The Bonferroni post hoc test was used for pairwise comparisons when
      the ANOVA test was significant. RESULTS: Zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate
      (Vita Suprinity) crowns showed the highest statistically significant (p < 0.05)
      mean fracture resistance values (1742.9 +/- 102.7 N), followed by lithium
      disilicate (IPS e.max CAD) (1565.2 +/- 89.7 N). Bilayered zirconia-based crowns
      showed the lowest statistically significantly mean fracture resistance values
      (1267.8 +/- 86.1 N). CONCLUSIONS: Monolithic reinforced glass-ceramics (lithium
      disilicate and zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate) have better fracture
      resistance than bilayered zirconia-based ceramics. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The use
      of monolithic reinforced ceramic restorations (lithium disilicate and
      zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate) is preferred to bilayered zirconia-based
      restorations to avoid chipping of the ceramic veneer.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the fracture load of differently
      fabricated 3-unit posterior fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with an intermediate
      pontic. METHODS: Fifty sets of two stainless-steel abutments were randomly
      assigned to five groups (n=10 each) depending on the material and technique used 
      for manufacturing the FDPs: (1) Metal-ceramic (MC, control); (2) Lava Zirconia
      (LZ, bi-layered); (3) Lava Plus (LM, monolithic); (4) VITA In-Ceram YZ (YZ,
      bi-layered); and (5) IPS e-max ZirCAD (ZZ, bi-layered). After being luted to the 
      dies, all FDPs were submitted to thermo-mechanical cycling (120,000 masticatory
      cycles, 50N; plus 774 thermal cycles of 5 degrees C/55 degrees C, dwell time:
      30s). Samples were then subjected to a three-point bending test until fracture in
      a universal testing machine (cross-head speed: 1mm/min). Fracture load of the
      veneering ceramic (VF) and total fracture load (TF) were recorded. Microstructure
      and failure patterns were assessed. Data was analysed using one-way ANOVA and
      Tukey HSD post-hoc tests (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: MC restorations recorded higher
      VF and TF values than did zirconia FDPs (p=0.0001), which showed no between-group
      differences. Within the bi-layered groups, TF was significantly higher than VF.
      LM pieces registered lower average grain size than did LZ specimens (p=0.001).
      Overall, the connector was the weakest part. CONCLUSIONS: All of the groups
      tested could withstand clinical chewing forces in terms of average fracture load.
      Zirconia-based samples performed similarly to each other, but showed lower mean
      fracture load values than did metal-ceramic ones. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
      Monolithic zirconia may be recommendable for solving the chipping problem.

TI  - Impact of prosthetic material on mid- and long-term outcome of dental implants
      supporting single crowns and fixed partial dentures: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 47-65
AB  - AIM: The impact of prosthetic material selection on implant survival is not
      clear. The current criteria for choosing a prosthetic material seem to be based
      on clinician preferences. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of
      restorative materials on the mid- and long-term survival of implants supporting
      single crowns and fixed partial dentures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hand and MEDLINE
      searches were performed to identify relevant literature for single crowns (SC)
      and fixed partial dentures (FPD). Further inclusion criteria were a mean
      follow-up period of at least 3 years, the inclusion of at least 10 patients in a 
      relevant study cohort, and a clear description of prosthesis type and prosthetic 
      material. RESULTS: A total of 63 studies for the SC group and 11 studies for the 
      FPD group were included. Full arch restorations were not included. The materials 
      utilised in the SC group were metal-ceramic (precious and non-precious),
      lithium-disilicate, veneered zirconia, veneered alumina, and nanoceramics. The
      materials used in the FPD group were metal-ceramic (precious), veneered titanium,
      metal-resin (precious), and veneered zirconia. No significant impact on the
      prosthetic material relating to mid- or long-term implant survival was
      identified. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences
      between the survival rates of the dental prostheses made from different materials
      (SC and FPD group). Single crowns made of nanoceramics showed a higher risk for
      decementation relative to other materials (0.80, 95% CI [0.67; 0.89]; P <
      0.0001), whereas metal-resin FPDs showed a higher risk for chipping (0.36, 95% CI
      [0.23; 0.52]; P = 0.0072). CONCLUSION: The current evidence suggests that
      prosthetic material selection has no influence on mid- and long-term survival of 
      implants restored with single crowns and fixed partial dentures. Similarly, the
      prosthetic material seems to have no significant impact on prosthetic survival
      rates. Further research is required to provide more evidence regarding the impact
      of the prosthetic material on long-term outcome. Conflict-of-interest statement: 
      The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

PG  - 256-8
LID - 10.11607/ijp.4541 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the marginal fit of
      posterior fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) made of monolithic and veneered
      computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) zirconia ceramic
      with metal-ceramic posterior FDPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty standardized
      steel dies were prepared to receive posterior three-unit FDPs. Specimens were
      randomly divided into three groups (n = 10): (1) metal-ceramic (control group),
      (2) veneered zirconia, and (3) monolithic zirconia. All FDPs were cemented using 
      a glass-ionomer cement. The specimens were subjected to thermal cycling (5
      degrees C to 55 degrees C). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a
      magnification of x500 was used for measurements. The data were statistically
      analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and paired t test. RESULTS: Both
      zirconia groups showed similar vertical marginal discrepancies, and no
      significant differences (P = .661) in marginal adaptation were observed among the
      groups. No differences were observed in either group in marginal discrepancies
      between surfaces or abutments. CONCLUSION: Monolithic zirconia posterior FDPs
      exhibit similar vertical marginal discrepancies to veneered zirconia posterior
      FDPs. No influence of localization measurements was observed.

TI  - Outcome of bonded vs all-ceramic and metal- ceramic fixed prostheses for single
      tooth replacement.
PG  - S25-44
AB  - AIM: The conventional treatment of a single missing tooth is most frequently
      based on the provision of a fixed dental prosthesis (FDPs). A variety of designs 
      and restorative materials are available which have an impact on the treatment
      outcome. Consequently, it was the aim of this review to compare resin-bonded,
      all-ceramic and metal-ceramic FDPs based on existing evidence. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: An electronic literature search using ""metal-ceramic"" AND ""fixed dental 
      prosthesis"" AND ""clinical, all-ceramic"" AND ""fixed dental prosthesis"" AND
      ""clinical, resin-bonded"" AND ""fixed dental prosthesis"" AND ""clinical, fiber
      reinforced composite"" AND ""clinical, monolithic"" AND ""zirconia"" AND ""clinical""
      was conducted and supplemented by the manual searching of bibliographies from
      articles already included. RESULTS: A total of 258 relevant articles were
      identified. Metal-ceramic FDPs still show the highest survival rates of all
      tooth-supported restorations. Depending on the ceramic system used, all-ceramic
      restorations may reach comparable survival rates while the technical
      complications, i.e. chipping fractures of veneering materials in particular, are 
      more frequent. Resin-bonded FDPs can be seen as long-term provisional
      restorations with the survival rate being higher in anterior locations and when a
      cantilever design is applied. Inlay-retained FDPs and the use of fiber-reinforced
      composites overall results in a compromised long-term prognosis. Recently
      advocated monolithic zirconia restorations bear the risk of low temperature
      degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Several variables affect treatment planning for a given
      patient situation, with survival and success rates of different restorative
      options representing only one factor. The broad variety of designs and materials 
      available for conventional tooth-supported restorations should still be
      considered as a viable treatment option for single tooth replacement.

TI  - Prosthetic protocols in implant-based oral rehabilitations: A systematic review
      on the clinical outcome of monolithic all-ceramic single- and multi-unit
      prostheses.
PG  - 89-99
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the clinical performance
      of implant-supported monolithic all-ceramic single- and multi-unit restorations. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic databases of MEDLINE via PubMed, the
      Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) and EMBASE were searched for clinical studies on
      monolithic all-ceramic single and multi-unit implant-supported fixed dental
      prostheses. Human studies with a mean follow-up of at least 2 years and published
      in English or German language peer-reviewed journals up until August 2016 were
      included. Two independent examiners conducted the literature search and review
      process. RESULTS: The search resulted in 2510 titles and of these, 57 studies
      were selected for full-text evaluation. Three studies were included on the basis 
      of the pre-determined criteria. Two articles reported on monolithic lithium
      disilicate implant-supported single crowns (SC) and revealed a survival rate of
      97,8 and 100% after 3 years. One study investigated implant- supported monolithic
      zirconia SCs and fixed partial dentures (FPD) and showed a survival rate of 100% 
      after 5 years. No studies could be identified on the clinical performance of
      monolithic resin matrix ceramic restorations. Clinical studies are lacking on the
      long-term outcome of implant-supported monolithic all-ceramic single- and
      multi-unit restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary clinical data indicate high
      short-term survival for implant-supported monolithic lithium disilicate and
      zirconia single- and multi-unit restorations. Randomised clinical studies and
      observations with a longer duration are necessary to validate the broad
      application of this therapy. Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare 
      no conflict of interest.

TI  - A critical appraisal of the survival and complication rates of tooth-supported
      all-ceramic and metal-ceramic fixed dental prostheses: the application of
      evidence-based dentistry.
PG  - 417-27
AB  - PURPOSE: This paper aimed to practice evidence-based dentistry by critically
      appraising relevant evidence to address a common question in prosthodontics. It
      sought to answer whether the survival and complication rates of all-ceramic fixed
      dental prostheses (FDPs) were comparable or superior to those of metal-ceramic
      FDPs, and to use this knowledge to guide clinical decisions. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A 6S search was conducted. No decision support systems or summaries were
      available. The journal Evidence-Based Dentistry (zero synopses), Trip database
      (three synopses, discarded), Cochrane database (three systematic reviews,
      discarded), MEDLINE OVID (six systematic reviews, one accepted), and Embase (zero
      systematic reviews) were searched. The selected systematic review assessed the
      survival and complication rates of all-ceramic and metal-ceramic FDPs. One
      additional prospective cohort study was considered relevant. RESULTS: The
      systematic review addressed a well-focused clinical question, but its internal
      validity was compromised. The search was not systematic; inclusion methodology
      and impact of study characteristics on results were unclear. The external
      applicability was limited by compromised internal validity, broad outcome
      definitions, inaccurate results, and incomplete examination of stated aims. With 
      care, however, the results could be applied to clinical practice. Estimated event
      rates and 5-year outcomes with a 95% confidence interval were calculated, with
      the survival rate of metal-ceramic FDPs significantly higher than that of
      all-ceramic FDPs. All-ceramic FDPs experienced a high incidence of technical
      failure. The prospective cohort addressed a well-focused clinical question with
      good internal validity. It compared outcomes of metal-ceramic FDPs provided
      before and after the introduction of implant therapy. Patient cohorts were
      clearly defined, similar at baseline, and treated equally. Ten-year Kaplan-Meier 
      cumulative survival with standard errors was reported. Metal-ceramic FDP survival
      rates were high and significantly improved since the introduction of implants and
      the decreased use of structurally compromised abutments. CONCLUSION: The results 
      of the systematic review and prospective cohort were complementary: Metal-ceramic
      FDPs had high survival, with a significantly greater 5-year survival rate than
      all-ceramic FDPs. Differences in complications were unknown, but evidence
      indicated that the complication incidence of metal-ceramic FDPs was lower than
      that of all-ceramic FDPs. This evidence was directly applicable to the clinical
      scenario and will help guide clinical decision making.

TI  - Static and Fatigue Loading of Veneered Implant-Supported Fixed Dental Prostheses.
PG  - 679-685
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13173 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the load to failure and the probability of
      survival of porcelain fused to zirconia (PFZ) three-unit, implant-supported,
      fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) to those of indirect composites veneered to either
      zirconia (CVZ) or milled fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) frameworks under static
      and fatigue loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred and twenty posterior
      three-unit FDP (second premolar pontic) frameworks were fabricated via milling
      from a single Standard Tessellation Language (STL) file. The FDPs were divided
      into three groups. Each group (n = 40) was subjected to static (n = 20) and
      fatigue (n = 20) loading tests, as follows: (1) PFZ: zirconia framework layered
      with porcelain veneer; (2) CVZ: zirconia framework veneered with indirect
      composite resin; and (3) FRC: FRC framework veneered with indirect composite
      resin. After porcelain veneering onto sintered zirconia frameworks, or resin
      composite veneering onto zirconia or FRC frameworks, FDPs were cemented on their 
      abutments using self-adhesive resin cement. After thermal cycling, half of the
      FDPs were subjected to an accelerated fatigue test. The other half of the FDPs
      were subjected to single load-to-failure (SLF) testing at a crosshead speed (1
      mm/min). Lifetime analysis was conducted to determine the probability of
      survival, and fractographic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Significant
      differences were observed among the studied groups for SLF with the highest
      characteristic strength values observed for PFZ (2154 N), followed by 1905.47 N
      for CVZ and 1679.56 N for FRC. The probability of survival for 100,000 cycles at 
      500 N was the highest for FRC (98%) and CVZ (100%) and was significantly lower
      for PFZ (88%). Different fracture patterns were observed in the fractography.
      CONCLUSIONS: In fatigue testing, which simulates masticatory function better than
      static tests, a higher probability of survival was observed for FRC and CVZ than 
      for PFZ. Framework fractures were not observed only for the FRC group, indicating
      that chairside repair with the addition of indirect composite could be performed 
      for continued function.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 5-year clinical outcome of posterior inlay-retained
      fixed dental prostheses (IRFDPs) with a modified design made from zirconia
      ceramic (Vita In-Ceram YZ, Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany). METHODS:
      Thirty 3-unit IRFDPs were placed in 30 patients. Seven IRFDPs replaced the second
      premolars (4 in the maxilla, 3 in the mandible), and 23 replaced the first molars
      (15 in the maxilla, 8 in the mandible). Preparations were performed in accordance
      with general principles for ceramic inlay restorations and modified with a short 
      retainer-wing bevel preparation within the enamel at the buccal and oral sides.
      The frameworks were milled from zirconia ceramic, and the pontics were veneered
      with feldspathic ceramic. After air-abrasion of bonding surfaces, IRFDPs were
      bonded with an adhesive composite resin. The patients were recalled 6-12 months
      after placement, and then annually. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate
      the survival and complication rates of the IRFDPs. RESULTS: After a mean
      observation time of 64.4 (SD=17.6) months (min 15, max 95.6), the 5-year
      cumulative survival of IRFDPs was 95.8%. Debonding was reported for two IRFDPs
      (6.9%), one of them failed finally after 49.4 months due to repeated debonding.
      Chipping of the veneering ceramic was reported in three cases (10.5%). Secondary 
      caries were reported in 2 patients (8.1%). Nevertheless, the latter complications
      did not affect the clinical function of the involved IRFDPs. CONCLUSION: The
      5-year clinical outcome of zirconia-based IRFDPs fabricated in the modified
      design is encouraging, so that they may represent a treatment alternative to
      replace posterior single missing teeth, taking into consideration the appropriate
      case selection.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Access channels for retrieving ceramic implant-supported
      screw-retained crowns may decrease their fracture resistance. PURPOSE: The
      purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of screw-access
      channels on 3 types of ceramic implant-supported crowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Sixty computer-aided designed and computer-aided manufactured (CAD-CAM) ceramic
      implant-supported screw-retained maxillary premolar crowns were fabricated, 30
      with an occlusal screw-access channel and 30 without access channels. Each group 
      was further divided into the following 3 subgroups of 10 specimens each:
      monolithic zirconia, veneered zirconia, and lithium disilicate. Identical milled 
      titanium implant abutments were fabricated. Crowns were fabricated with
      standardized thicknesses and subjected to cyclic loading until failure occurred. 
      Data analysis was performed using 1-way analysis of variance test of significance
      followed by Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: 
      No significant differences in fracture resistance were found between access
      channel groups and corresponding groups without access channels (P>.05). Among
      the subgroups, monolithic zirconia recorded the highest fatigue failure mean load
      values (2047.8 +/-83.2 N for crowns with access channels and 2028.7 +/-104.5 N
      for crowns without access channels), which was significantly higher (P<.05) than 
      values for the lithium disilicate group (605.4 +/-37.9 N for crowns with access
      channels and 615.3 +/-76.6 N for crowns without access channels) and the veneered
      zirconia group (411 +/-34.4 N for crowns with access channels and 461.2 +/-72.7 N
      for crowns without access channels), which recorded the lowest fatigue failure
      load mean values. CONCLUSIONS: Screw-access channels did not affect the fatigue
      failure load of monolithic zirconia, monolithic lithium disilicate, or veneered
      zirconia ceramic crowns. Monolithic zirconia crowns recorded significantly higher
      fatigue failure load among the 3 types of crowns tested.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To monitor zirconia-ceramic and metal-ceramic posterior FDPs with
      respect to survival and technical/biological complication rates. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Fifty-eight patients received 76 3- to 5-unit posterior FDPs. The sites 
      were randomly assigned to 40 zirconia-based (ZC) and 36 metal-based (MC) FDPs.
      FDPs were examined at baseline (cementation), at 6 months, at 1year and then
      yearly up to 10 years. Technical outcomes were assessed using modified United
      States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Biologic outcomes included probing
      depth, plaque, bleeding on probing and tooth vitality. Statistical analysis was
      performed applying Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimation, log-rank, Mann-Whitney and
      Fisher exact test. RESULTS: During the 10-year follow-up thirteen patients (17
      FDPs) dropped out and 6 FDPs in 6 patients (5 ZC,1 MC) were considered
      catastrophic failures for technical and/or biological reasons. Forty-four
      patients with 53 FDPs (29 ZC, 24 MC) were available for examination. The median
      observation period was 10.3 years (ZC) and 10.0 years (MC). The 10-year KM
      survival estimate of ZC FDPs was 91.3% (95%CI:69.5;97.8) and 100% of MC FDPs.
      Minor chipping of the veneering ceramic and occlusal wear were found to a similar
      extent at ZC and MC FDPs. ZC FDPs demonstrated a significantly higher rate of
      framework fracture, de-bonding, major fractures of the veneering ceramic and poor
      marginal adaption. Biological outcomes were similar in both groups and between
      abutment and control teeth. CONCLUSION: At 10 years, ZC and MC posterior FDPs
      resulted in similar outcomes for the majority of the outcome measures (p>0.05).

TI  - Retrospective analysis of porcelain failures of metal ceramic crowns and fixed
      partial dentures supported by 729 implants in 152 patients: patient-specific and 
      implant-specific predictors of ceramic failure.
PG  - 388-94
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(09)60083-4 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Porcelain fracture associated with an implant-supported,
      metal ceramic crown or fixed partial denture occurs at a higher rate than in
      tooth-supported restorations, according to the literature. Implant-specific and
      patient-specific causes of ceramic failure have not been fully evaluated.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the potential
      statistical predictors for porcelain fracture of implant-supported, metal ceramic
      restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over a 6-month period, a consecutive series
      of patients having previously received implant-supported, metal ceramic fixed
      restorations were examined during periodic recall appointments. The number of
      supporting implants, number of dental units, type of restoration, date of
      prosthesis insertion, location in the dental arch, opposing dentition, type of
      occlusion, presence of parafunctional habits, use of an occlusal protective
      device, presence or absence of ceramic fractures, gender, and age were recorded
      for each patient. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach was used for
      the intrasubject correlated measurements analysis of categorical outcomes
      (presence or absence of ceramic fractures) to determine which patient- and
      implant-specific factors would predict porcelain fracture (alpha=.05). RESULTS:
      Data were collected from 152 patients representing 998 dental units (390 single
      crowns and 94 fixed partial dentures) supported by 729 implants. Porcelain
      fractures of 94 dental units occurred in 35 patients. The fractures were
      significantly (P<.05) associated with opposing implant-supported metal ceramic
      restorations, bruxism, and not wearing a protective occlusal device. Metal
      ceramic prostheses (single crown or fixed partial dentures) had approximately 7
      times higher odds of porcelain fracture (odds ratio (OR)=7.06; 95% confidence
      interval (CI): 2.57 to 19.37) and 13 times greater odds of a fracture requiring
      either repair or replacement (OR=13.95; 95% CI: 2.25 to 86.41) when in occlusion 
      with another implant-supported restoration, as compared to opposing a natural
      tooth. In addition, patients exhibiting bruxism or not wearing an occlusal device
      had approximately 7 times higher odds (OR=7.23; 95% CI: 3.86 to 13.54), and 2
      times higher odds (OR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.67) of porcelain fracture when
      compared to patients without bruxism and patients not wearing an occlusal device.
      CONCLUSIONS: Implant-supported metal ceramic single crowns and fixed partial
      dentures were found to have a significantly higher risk of porcelain fracture in 
      patients with bruxism habits, when a protective occlusal device was not used, and
      when the restoration opposed another implant-supported metal ceramic restoration.

PG  - 135-153

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate implant survival, peri-implant marginal bone loss,
      technical, and biological complications as well as aesthetic outcomes of zirconia
      implants in clinical studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic (Medline, Embase) 
      and hand searches were performed to identify clinical studies published between
      January 2004 and March 2017 investigating zirconia dental implants with a mean
      follow-up of at least 12 months. Primary outcomes were implant survival and
      peri-implant marginal bone loss. Secondary outcomes included technical and
      biological complications as well as aesthetic outcomes. Meta-analyses were
      performed to estimate implant survival and marginal bone loss. RESULTS: From 943 
      titles, 264 abstracts were selected. Subsequently, 80 full-text articles were
      screened, and 18 studies were included for data extraction. One- (14 studies) and
      2-piece zirconia implants (4 studies) were investigated. Commercially available
      (CA) (510 implants, 398 patients) and not commercially available (NCA) zirconia
      implants (618 implants, 343 patients) were identified. For CA implants
      (follow-up: 12-61.20 months), technical complications (1.6%), implant fractures
      (0.2%) and biological complications (4.2%) were reported. Meta-analyses estimated
      1- and 2-year survival rates of 98.3% (95% CI: 97.0%-99.6%) and 97.2% (95% CI:
      94.7%-99.7%), respectively, and a mean 1-year marginal bone loss of 0.7 mm (95%
      CI: 0.4-1.0 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Since 2004, the survival rates of CA implants
      significantly improved compared with NCA implants. CA 1-piece zirconia implants
      showed similar 1- and 2-year mean survival rates and marginal bone loss after 1
      year compared with published data for titanium implants. However, more clinical
      long-term data are needed to confirm the presently evaluated promising short-term
      outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore fatigue limits of ceramic endocrowns for premolars.
      METHODS: Forty-eight devitalized premolars were cut at the CEJ. They were
      restored with standardized CAD-CAM lithium disilicate reinforced ceramic
      restorations (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent) and divided into four Groups
      (n=12): overlays (Group A, no endo-core, negative control), endocrowns with an
      endo-core of 2mm (Group B), 4mm (GroupC) and crowns with post and core (Group D, 
      positive control). All specimens were first submitted to thermo-mechanical cyclic
      loading (TCML)(1.7Hz, 49N, 600000 cycles, 1500 thermo-cycles). Margins were
      analysed before and after the loading. Survived specimens were then submitted to 
      cyclic isometric stepwise loading (5Hz, 200N to 1200N) until completion of 105000
      cycles or failure. In case of fracture, fragments were analysed using SEM and
      failure mode was determined. Results of stepwise loading were statistically
      analysed by Kaplan-Meier life survival analysis and log rank test (p=0.05).
      RESULTS: All the specimens survived the TCML test except four specimens of Group 
      A (early restorations' debonding). No difference in percentages of closed margins
      was found between endocrowns (Groups B, C) and crowns (Group D). After the
      stepwise test, differences in survival within the groups were not statistically
      significant. Most of restorations experienced non-reparable fracture.
      CONCLUSIONS: Endocrowns with both 2-mm and 4-mm long endo-cores displayed
      outcomes after fatigue equivalent to classical crowns. Results of this study
      discourage the use of flat overlays with only adhesive retention. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: When restoring extremely destroyed devitalized premolars, adhesive 
      strategies should be coupled to a macro-mechanical retention in the root.

TI  - Implant rehabilitation of edentulous jaws with predominantly monolithic zirconia 
      compared to metal-acrylic prostheses: a 2-year retrospective clinical study.
PG  - 99-112
LID - 10.23812/21-4supp1-9 [doi]
AB  - Limited data are available on the clinical outcomes of patients with edentulism
      treated with predominantly monolithic zirconia fixed complete dentures (FCDs)
      compared to traditional restoration materials. The purpose of this study was to
      analyze the differences in terms of complications and failures of definitive
      full-arch implant rehabilitations made in metal-acrylic versus those made in
      monolithic zirconia with porcelain veneering limited to non-functional areas.
      This retrospective clinical study included 50 patients treated between January
      2015 and December 2018, with 222 implants inserted in fifty edentulous jaws. All 
      patients were treated with immediately loaded full-arch fixed prostheses (22
      maxillary; 28 mandibular) each supported by four to six implants (two/four axial,
      two distally tilted). All 25 zirconia prostheses were predominantly monolithic
      with ceramic veneering limited to non-functional areas. The primary outcome
      measures were prosthetic success of the definitive restoration and implant
      survival. The secondary outcome measures were full mouth plaque score, full mouth
      bleeding score, peri-implant probing depths and periimplant keratinized tissue.
      All implants and prostheses analyzed had a minimum of 2 years of followup. No
      chipping of the veneered facial porcelain or other technical complication was
      observed over the study period achieving a prosthesis survival and success rate
      of 100%. No implants were lost, achieving a 100% survival rate. Bleeding on
      probing was positive in 33% and 13% of probing sites for metal-acrylic prosthesis
      and zirconia prosthesis, respectively (p = 0.0445). Plaque index was positive in 
      76% and 53% of probing sites for metal-acrylic prosthesis and zirconia
      prosthesis, respectively (p = 0.0491). Mean probing depth was 1.74mm (SD 0.89mm) 
      for the 106 implants supporting metal-acrylic prosthesis and 1.52mm (SD 0.63mm)
      for the 116 implants supporting zirconia prosthesis (p=0.0412). No other
      statistically significant differences were found between the two groups. The
      results of this retrospective evaluation showed that predominantly monolithic
      zirconia is a feasible alternative to the conventional metal framework acrylic
      for full arch implant-supported prosthesis. The restauration material did not
      influence the failure rate and complication risk of both prosthesis and implants.

TI  - Monolithic CAD-CAM lithium disilicate versus monolithic CAD-CAM zirconia for
      single implant-supported posterior crowns using a digital workflow: A 3-year
      cross-sectional retrospective study.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Dentistry has evolved significantly with the introduction
      of digital technologies and materials; however, clinical evidence for the
      performance of the complete digital workflow for single implant-supported
      posterior crowns is lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this cross-sectional
      retrospective clinical study was to compare the clinical outcomes of 2 types of
      implant-supported crown used to replace a single missing posterior tooth in a
      completely digital workflow: transocclusal screw-retained monolithic lithium
      disilicate crowns versus transocclusal screw-retained monolithic zirconia crowns.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 38 participants who had been provided with
      dental implants and transocclusal screw-retained monolithic lithium disilicate or
      zirconia single crowns were evaluated in the study. Clinical and esthetic
      outcomes were recorded after a 3-year follow-up. RESULTS: Both groups had
      comparable clinical outcomes with a survival rate of 100%. In the lithium
      disilicate group, 89% of the participants were free of technical complications,
      and 95%, in the zirconia group. Only 1 patient experienced minor chipping
      affecting a lithium disilicate crown. All complications were considered minor and
      were easily resolved, and none of the participants required replacement of a
      crown. No biological complications were recorded in either group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Within the limitations of this cross-sectional retrospective clinical study,
      monolithic lithium disilicate and zirconia screw-retained single crowns
      fabricated using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM)
      and a fully digital workflow were found to be reliable and suitable clinical
      options for restoring a posterior missing tooth on a dental implant.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A recent 3-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) of tooth supported 
      three- to five-unit zirconia-ceramic and metal-ceramic posterior fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) revealed that veneer chipping and fracture in zirconia-ceramic 
      systems occurred more frequently than those in metal-ceramic systems [1]. This
      study seeks to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the fracture
      phenomena observed in this RCT using a descriptive fractographic analysis.
      METHODS: Vinyl-polysiloxane impressions of 12 zirconia-ceramic and 6
      metal-ceramic FDPs with veneer fractures were taken from the patients at the end 
      of a mean observation of 40.3+/-2.8 months. Epoxy replicas were produced from
      these impressions [1]. All replicas were gold coated, and inspected under the
      optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) for descriptive
      fractography. RESULTS: Among the 12 zirconia-ceramic FDPs, 2 had small chippings,
      9 had large chippings, and 1 exhibited delamination. Out of 6 metal-ceramic FDPs,
      5 had small chippings and 1 had large chipping. Descriptive fractographic
      analysis based on SEM observations revealed that fracture initiated from the wear
      facet at the occlusal surface in all cases, irrespective of the type of
      restoration. SIGNIFICANCE: Zirconia-ceramic and metal-ceramic FDPs all fractured 
      from microcracks that emanated from occlusal wear facets. The relatively low
      fracture toughness and high residual tensile stress in porcelain veneer of
      zirconia restorations may contribute to the higher chipping rate and larger chip 
      size in zirconia-ceramic FDPs relative to their metal-ceramic counterparts. The
      low veneer/core interfacial fracture energy of porcelain-veneered zirconia may
      result in the occurrence of delamination in zirconia-ceramic FDPs.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Presently, data for the survival of 1-piece complete arch
      fixed implant-supported zirconia prostheses are limited. PURPOSE: The purpose of 
      this retrospective study was to evaluate the survival outcomes of 1-piece
      complete arch fixed implant-supported zirconia prostheses fabricated by a single 
      dental laboratory supporting several clinicians. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Outcome
      data were collected over a 5-year period from a large commercial dental
      laboratory that fabricated 2039 1-piece complete arch fixed implant-supported
      monolithic zirconia prostheses. All prostheses were fabricated using the same
      zirconia system from 1 manufacturer, using standardized protocols. The zirconia
      prostheses were predominantly monolithic, with veneered porcelain restricted to
      the gingival region. Because a 5-year warranty against fracture was offered by
      this dental laboratory, prostheses that were returned to the laboratory for
      remake because of catastrophic failure (fracture) or technical complications were
      identified, and data were analyzed using a life table. RESULTS: Of the 2039
      zirconia prostheses evaluated, at least 319 prostheses had a minimum of 3 years
      of clinical service, and 69 prostheses had a minimum of 4 years of clinical
      service. A total of 6 fractures were reported, resulting in a first-year interval
      survival rate of 99.8% and a 5-year cumulative survival rate of 99.3%. Six
      zirconia prostheses were returned to the laboratory during the 5-year period
      because of technical complications related to the debonding of titanium
      cylinders, and 3 prostheses were returned because of fracture of the titanium
      cylinders. No prostheses were returned because of chipping of the veneered
      gingival porcelain. CONCLUSIONS: Practice-based evidence from this large sample, 
      short-term retrospective study showed that 1-piece complete arch fixed
      implant-supported zirconia prostheses with veneered porcelain restricted to the
      gingival region showed a cumulative survival rate of 99.3% in a 5-year period.
      The technical complication rate related to this type of prosthesis was minimal.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the 5-year survival rates and incidences of complications
      of cemented and screw-retained implant reconstructions. METHODS: An electronic
      Medline search complemented by manual searching was conducted to identify
      randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), and prospective and retrospective
      studies giving information on cemented and screw-retained single-unit and
      multiple-unit implant reconstructions with a mean follow-up time of at least 1
      year. Assessment of the identified studies and data abstraction were performed
      independently by three reviewers. Failure rates were analyzed using Poisson
      regression models to obtain summary estimates and 95% confidence intervals of
      failure rates and 5-year survival proportions. RESULTS: Fifty-nine clinical
      studies were selected from an initial yield of 4511 titles and the data were
      extracted. For cemented single crowns the estimated 5-year reconstruction
      survival was 96.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 94.8-97.7%), for screw-retained
      single crowns it was 89.3% (95% CI: 64.9-97.1%) (P = 0.091 for difference). The
      5-year survival for cemented partial fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) was 96.9%
      (95% CI: 90.8-99%), similar to the one for screw-retained partial FDPs with 98%
      (95% CI: 96.2-99%) (P = 0.47). For cemented full-arch FDPs the 5-year survival
      was 100% (95% CI: 88.9-100%), which was somewhat higher than that for
      screw-retained FDPs with 95.8% (95% CI: 91.9-97.9%) (P = 0.54). The estimated
      5-year cumulative incidence of technical complications at cemented single crowns 
      was 11.9% and 24.4% at screw-retained crowns. At the partial and full-arch FDPs, 
      in contrast, a trend to less complication at the screw-retained was found than at
      the cemented ones (partial FDPs cemented 24.5%, screw-retained 22.1%; full-arch
      FDPs cemented 62.9%, screw-retained 54.1%). Biological complications like
      marginal bone loss >2 mm occurred more frequently at cemented crowns (5-year
      incidence: 2.8%) than at screw-retained ones (5-year incidence: 0%). CONCLUSION: 
      Both types of reconstructions influenced the clinical outcomes in different ways,
      none of the fixation methods was clearly advantageous over the other. Cemented
      reconstructions exhibited more serious biological complications (implant loss,
      bone loss >2 mm), screw-retained reconstructions exhibited more technical
      problems. Screw-retained reconstructions are more easily retrievable than
      cemented reconstructions and, therefore, technical and eventually biological
      complications can be treated more easily. For this reason and for their
      apparently higher biological compatibility, these reconstructions seem to be
      preferable.

TI  - Survival Rate of Resin and Ceramic Inlays, Onlays, and Overlays: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 985-94
LID - 10.1177/0022034516652848 [doi]
AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the survival rate of
      ceramic and resin inlays, onlays, and overlays and to identify the complication
      types associated with the main clinical outcomes. Two reviewers searched PubMed, 
      EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles
      published between 1983 through April 2015, conforming to Preferred Reporting
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for systematic reviews.
      Clinical studies meeting the following criteria were included: 1) studies related
      to resin and ceramic inlays, onlays, and overlays; 2) prospective, retrospective,
      or randomized controlled trials conducted in humans; 3) studies with a dropout
      rate of less than 30%; and 4) studies with a follow-up longer than 5 y. Of 1,389 
      articles, 14 met the inclusion criteria. The meta-regression indicated that the
      type of ceramic material (feldspathic porcelain vs. glass-ceramic), study design 
      (retrospective vs. prospective), follow-up time (5 vs. 10 y), and study setting
      (university vs. private clinic) did not affect the survival rate. Estimated
      survival rates for glass-ceramics and feldspathic porcelain were between 92% and 
      95% at 5 y (n = 5,811 restorations) and were 91% at 10 y (n = 2,154
      restorations). Failures were related to fractures/chipping (4%), followed by
      endodontic complications (3%), secondary caries (1%), debonding (1%), and severe 
      marginal staining (0%). Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.19 (0.04 to
      0.96) and 0.54 (0.17 to 1.69) for pulp vitality and type of tooth involved
      (premolars vs. molars), respectively. Ceramic inlays, onlays, and overlays showed
      high survival rates at 5 y and 10 y, and fractures were the most frequent cause
      of failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aims at comparing the fracture resistance of different
      restorative materials used in dental endocrown restorations and respective
      endocrown restorations under a quasi-static compressive load using acoustic
      emission (AE) method. METHODS: Five restorative materials were used in this
      study. The restorative materials were manufactured into discs 13mm in diameter
      and 5mm thick, which were then divided into 5 groups and included into Type 1:
      Group B: zirconium dioxide (Prettau zirconia); Group C: ceramics (IPS e.max
      Press); Group D: metal ceramics (GC Initial MC+Nicrallium N2 BCS); Group E:
      composite resin (Nano Q); Group F: luting cement (RelyX U200). Twenty-five
      extracted human molars were divided into 5 groups and included into Type 2: Group
      A: control, no restoration; Group BE: restored by zirconium dioxide endocrowns;
      Group CE: restored by ceramic endocrowns; Group DE: restored by metal ceramic
      endocrowns; Group EE: restored by composite resin endocrowns. An increasing load 
      was applied to the center of the samples with a hard steel ball until a fracture 
      occurred. The loading rate was 0.12mm/min. An AE system was used to monitor the
      fracture of the samples. The load corresponding to the first AE event and the
      final fracture load were used to evaluate the fracture resistance of the restored
      teeth. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's post hot test (alpha=0.05).
      RESULTS: A lower threshold of 220muV was selected to exclude spurious background 
      signals. For the initial fracture load of Type 1 samples, Group F (0.029kN)<Group
      E (0.039kN)<Group D (0.056kN)<Group C (0.253kN)<Group B (intact). The same trend 
      was found for the final fracture load, i.e., Group F (1.289kN)<Group E
      (1.735kN)<Group D (3.362kN)<Group C (6.449kN)<Group B (intact). For the initial
      and final fracture load, statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were
      found between group C and the others groups. For the initial fracture load of
      Type 2 samples, Group EE (0.069kN)<Group DE (0.072kN)<Group CE (0.148kN)<Group BE
      (2.511kN). For the final fracture load, Group EE (1.533kN)<Group CE
      (2.726kN)<Group BE (3.082 kN)<Group DE (3.320kN). The initial fracture load of
      the ceramic samples is somewhat higher than that for the endocrown restorations
      with the endocrowns made of this material (0.253 and 0.148kN, respectively). At
      the same time, for the metal ceramic and composite resin samples, the initial
      fracture loads are somewhat lower than in case of compression of the endocrown
      restorations with the endocrowns made of these materials (0.056 and 0.072kN;
      0.039 and 0.069kN, respectively). The final fracture load of all the samples of
      the dental materials exceeds the strength of the respective endocrown
      restorations. The final fracture loads of the endocrown restorations with
      zirconium dioxide and ceramic endocrowns (3.082 and 2.726kN, respectively) are
      significantly lower than the final fracture load of the respective endocrown
      materials (intact and 6.449kN, respectively). SIGNIFICANCE: Dental restorations
      should be made of high-strength materials. Zirconia displayed the highest
      fracture strength, while composite resin had the lowest fracture strength out of 
      the materials used for the endocrowns. For teeth restored with endocrowns, the
      use of metal ceramics as endocrown material may lower the risk of failure during 
      clinical use.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical performance and the
      fracture behavior of endocrown restorations prepared using distinct restorative
      materials. A total of 42 sound molars with similar crown size and shape were cut 
      at 2 mm above the cementoenamel junction and endodontically treated. They were
      categorized according to the restorative material used to fabricate endocrown
      restorations (n=7), namely, conventional composite (Filtek Z350 XT), bulk fill
      composite (Filtek Bulk Fill), conventional composite modeled using resin
      adhesives (SBMP: Scotchbond Multipurpose Adhesive; or SBU: Scotchbond Universal
      Adhesive), and IPS e.max lithium disilicate (Ivoclar Vivadent; positive control).
      Unprepared sound teeth were used as negative control. All endocrowns were bonded 
      using a self-adhesive cement (Rely-X U200). The teeth were submitted to fatigue
      (Byocycle) and fracture (EMIC DL500) testing. Load-to-fracture (in N) and
      work-of-fracture (Wf, in J/m2) values were analyzed by ANOVA (p < 0.05). The
      endocrowns did not fracture or de-bond upon fatigue, showing similar
      load-to-fracture and work-of-fracture values, regardless of the restorative
      material (p > 0.05). The endocrowns fabricated by combining Z350 and SBMP had the
      least harsh fractures, in contrast to endocrowns prepared using Z350 only, which 
      exhibited an equilibrium between repairable and irrepairable fractures. The e.max
      endocrowns exhibited more aggressive failures (root fracture) than other groups, 
      resulting in higher rates of irrepairable fractures. In conclusion, dental
      practitioners may satisfactorily restore severely damaged nonvital teeth using
      the endocrown technique. Composite endocrowns prepared using resin adhesive as
      modeler liquid or using bulk fill material may result in less aggressive
      failures, thus providing a new material perspective for endocrown restorations.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Clinical studies are needed to evaluate the entire digital 
      and conventional workflows in prosthetic dentistry. PURPOSE: The purpose of the
      second part of this clinical study was to compare the laboratory production time 
      for tooth-supported single crowns made with 4 different digital workflows and 1
      conventional workflow and to compare these crowns clinically. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: For each of 10 participants, a monolithic crown was fabricated in
      lithium disilicate-reinforced glass ceramic (IPS e.max CAD). The computer-aided
      design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) systems were Lava C.O.S. CAD
      software and centralized CAM (group L), Cares CAD software and centralized CAM
      (group iT), Cerec Connect CAD software and lab side CAM (group CiL), and Cerec
      Connect CAD software with centralized CAM (group CiD). The conventional
      fabrication (group K) included a wax pattern of the crown and heat pressing
      according to the lost-wax technique (IPS e.max Press). The time for the
      fabrication of the casts and the crowns was recorded. Subsequently, the crowns
      were clinically evaluated and the corresponding treatment times were recorded.
      The Paired Wilcoxon test with the Bonferroni correction was applied to detect
      differences among treatment groups (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The total mean
      (+/-standard deviation) active working time for the dental technician was 88 +/-6
      minutes in group L, 74 +/-12 minutes in group iT, 74 +/-5 minutes in group CiL,
      92 +/-8 minutes in group CiD, and 148 +/-11 minutes in group K. The dental
      technician spent significantly more working time for the conventional workflow
      than for the digital workflows (P<.001). No statistically significant differences
      were found between group L and group CiD or between group iT and group CiL. No
      statistical differences in time for the clinical evaluation were found among
      groups, indicating similar outcomes (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of the
      CAD-CAM system, the overall laboratory working time for a digital workflow was
      significantly shorter than for the conventional workflow, since the dental
      technician needed less active working time.

AB  - PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the
      difference in longevity of tooth-supported ceramic prostheses designed by
      conventional and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)
      techniques. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers searched the Web of Science, PubMed,
      SCOPUS and LILACS databases between 1966 and October 2017. Clinical studies that 
      compared the survival rate of CAD/CAM against conventional restorations were
      included. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials and three prospective
      studies were included, n=14. Three types of tooth-supported restorations were
      searched in the included studies: single crown, multiple-unit and partial ceramic
      crown. The follow-up of patients in the studies ranged from 24 to 84 months. A
      total of 1209 restorations had been placed in 957 patients in the included
      trials, and failures were analyzed by type and material restoration. From a total
      of 72 restoration failures, the CAD/CAM system resulted in a 1.84 (IC95%:
      1.28-2.63) higher risk than conventional manufacturing of ceramic restoration.
      Nevertheless, when drop-outs were included as a failure risk, the CAD/CAM system 
      resulted in a risk of 1.32 (IC95%: 1.10-1.58). Multilevel analysis of
      tooth-supported ceramic restorations, considering drop-outs as successes,
      resulted in rates of 1.48 and 2.62 failures per 100 restoration-years for the
      controls and CAD/CAM groups, respectively. Considering drop-outs as failures, we 
      found rates of 4.23 and 5.88 failures per 100 restoration-years for the controls 
      and CAD/CAM groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis results suggest 
      that the longevity of a tooth-supported ceramic prostheses made by CAD/CAM
      manufacturing is lower than that of crowns mad by the conventional technique.

AB  - Screw-retained implant-supported ceramic restorations have shown increased rates 
      of technical complications compared with their cemented counterparts, including
      fracture and chipping of the ceramic structures. The present clinical report
      identified the causes leading to the catastrophic failure of a screw-retained
      lithium disilicate veneered crown cemented to a zirconia abutment with a titanium
      base by using a systematic fractographic approach. A combination of occlusal
      overloading, a deficient design and inadequate material selection was identified 
      as being responsible for the fracture. These findings highlight the importance of
      a thorough analysis of the anatomic conditions and loading scenario of
      screw-retained implant-supported restorations.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Recently, technical problems, especially chipping, have
      been reported for ceramic restorations; as a result, ceramic crowns produced
      entirely by computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) have
      become popular because the incidence of chipping is less. PURPOSE: The purpose of
      this study was to report on 2-year results for 2 different types of CAD/CAM
      ceramic crowns placed in adult patients in a dental practice. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Sixty participants who required a crown for a first or second molar were
      randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Crowns in the veneered zirconia (VZ) group
      were made of zirconia frameworks veneered with CAD/CAM-produced lithium
      disilicate ceramic; the other group's crowns were made of monolithic lithium
      disilicate (MLD) ceramic. Each crown was reviewed after 2 weeks, 1 year, and 2
      years by using modified the US Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria.
      Statistical analysis was performed by using the log-rank test, nonparametric
      tests, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: All 60 participants were
      recalled after 1 and 2 years. In the VZ group, 2 endodontic complications
      occurred, and deterioration of periodontal health was observed for 3
      participants. In the MLD group, 2 endodontic complications occurred within 2
      years. In both of the groups, no caries or marginal discoloration was observed.
      No technical complications, for example, cracks, chipping, or fractures, were
      detected after 2 years. The shape and appearance of all crowns were assessed
      positively by the examining dentist. The log-rank test showed no significant
      differences in respect to technical or biologic complications (P=.324).
      CONCLUSION: For both types of single-crown restoration, no technical failures
      occurred. The number of biological complications did not differ significantly
      between the types of crowns.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD/CAM) generated restorations are gaining popularity. However, limited
      clinical evidence is available for single-unit posterior CAD/CAM restorations
      fabricated with established and newer crown materials. PURPOSE: The purpose of
      this clinical study was to assess the restoration quality of and gingival
      response to CAD/CAM fabricated posterior single-tooth restorations with different
      processing technologies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-two individuals in need of 
      posterior complete coverage crowns were recruited under an institutional review
      board approved protocol. Teeth were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: metal ceramic,
      lithium disilicate, and monolithic zirconia. An unprepared or minimally restored 
      tooth on the contralateral side was chosen as a control tooth for gingival
      measurements with each participant. Teeth were prepared and scanned intraorally
      by 1 of 3 experienced practitioners. A total of 32 restorations were digitally
      designed and fabricated with either milling technology or rapid-prototype
      printing and casting with conventional porcelain application. Restorations were
      evaluated with modified United States Public Health Service criteria for contour,
      marginal adaptation, occlusion, and shade. Gingival crevicular fluid volume and
      bleeding on probing were recorded preoperatively, at 1-month and 6-month
      postcementation visits. Polyvinyl siloxane impressions were made of the buccal
      margin of cemented restorations and evaluated with microcomputed tomography to
      assess marginal adaptation (horizontal discrepancy). The Mantel Haenszel row mean
      score was used to assess whether the crown systems differed with respect to the
      modified United States Public Health Service criteria. Linear mixed models were
      used to assess whether the average gingival volumes were affected by the
      explanatory variables (crown system, tooth status [treated vs control], or
      visit). A generalized estimating equation approach was used to assess whether
      bleeding on probing was affected by the explanatory variables. One-way ANOVA was 
      used to assess marginal discrepancy values among the crown systems (alpha=.05 for
      all tests). RESULTS: Twelve metal ceramic, 10 lithium disilicate, and 10 zirconia
      restorations were fabricated for 22 participants. Zirconia restorations were
      significantly different from the other 2 crown systems (P<.001) with respect to
      occlusion. No occlusal adjustment was needed on 80% of the zirconia restorations.
      The average gingival crevicular fluid volumes did not differ among crown systems,
      between treated and control groups, or over time. The average horizontal marginal
      discrepancy was significantly different between lithium disilicate and zirconia
      crowns (P=.027), with zirconia crowns having the least amount of horizontal
      marginal discrepancy. CONCLUSIONS: Given the small sample size and limitations of
      this study, CAD/CAM-generated restorations for posterior teeth made from
      different materials had acceptable clinical results.

TI  - Clinical quality and efficiency of monolithic glass ceramic crowns in the
      posterior area: digital compared with conventional workflows.
PG  - 215-223
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this clinical study was to test whether or not digital
      workflows for the fabrication of crowns render different clinical outcomes from
      the conventional pathway with respect to (1) crown quality, and (2) time
      efficiency. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For each of the 10 patients in need of one
      tooth-supported crown, five monolithic crowns were produced out of lithium
      disilicate reinforced glass ceramic. Four different optical impression and
      associated computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems
      were used for crown fabrication (digital workflows): (1) Lava C.O.S. scanner and 
      Lava C.O.S. and CARES CAD software, centralized CAM (group L); (2) Cadent iTero
      scanner, CARES CAD software and centralized CAM (group iT); (3) Cerec Bluecam,
      Cerec Connect CAD software, followed by laboratory-based CAM (group CiL); and (4)
      centralized CAM (group CiD). The conventional crown (group K) was fabricated
      based on a conventional silicone impression followed by a conventional wax-up and
      heat press technique. The examiners were blinded and evaluated the crowns
      clinically at the bisque-bake stage (initial try-in), and subsequently after
      finalization by a dental technician (final try-in). For the assessment of crown
      quality, modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria were used.
      Treatment times were recorded for clinical evaluation and adjustment. The quality
      ratings were analyzed descriptively. For both the continuous and ordinal
      outcomes, the non-parametric paired Wilcoxon test was applied, together with an
      appropriate Bonferroni correction to evaluate the differences between treatment
      groups. The results of the statistical analysis were interpreted globally at the 
      significance level P = 0.05. RESULTS: The clinical evaluation during the initial 
      and final try-ins demonstrated similar clinical outcome measures for crowns
      generated with the four digital workflows and the conventional workflow. No
      statistically significant differences of crown quality in any state were found
      between groups (P > 0.005). The total clinical treatment times measured were: 456
      +/- 240 s for L; 655 +/- 374 s for iT; 783 +/- 403 s for CiL; 556 +/- 285 s for
      CiD; and 833 +/- 451 s for K. No statistically significant differences in
      treatment times were found between the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the
      limitations of the present study, the monolithic ceramic crowns resulting from
      the four different CAD/CAM systems did not differ from the conventionally
      produced crowns with respect to the clinical quality rating and the treatment
      time efficiency.

TI  - No post-no core approach to restore severely damaged posterior teeth: An up to
      10-year retrospective study of documented endocrown cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present study were to (1) retrospectively
      evaluate documented cases of ceramic and composite endocrowns performed using
      immediate dentin sealing (IDS); (2) correlate failures with clinical parameters
      such as tooth preparation characteristics and occlusal parameters. METHODS: 99
      documented cases of endocrowns were evaluated after a mean observation period of 
      44.7+/-34.6months. A classification of restorations was established in function
      of the level of damage of residual tooth tissues after preparation, from 1 to 3. 
      Evaluation was performed according to FDI criteria and endodontic outcomes were
      analyzed. Occlusal risk factors were examined and fractographic analysis was
      performed in case of fracture. RESULTS: 48.4% of patients were shown to present
      occlusal risk factors. 75.8% of restorations were Class 3 endocrowns. 56.6% were 
      performed on molars, 41.4% on premolars and 2.0% on canines. 84.8% were performed
      in lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic and 12.1% in Polymer-Infiltrated Ceramic
      Network (PICN) material. The survival and success rates of endocrowns were 99.0% 
      and 89.9% respectively, while the 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimated survival and
      success rates were 98.8% and 54.9% respectively. Ten failures were detected:
      periodontal disease (n=3), endocrown debonding (n=2), minor chipping (n=2),
      caries recurrence (n=2) and major fractures (n=1). Due to the reduced amount of
      failures, no statistical correlation could be established with clinical
      parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Endocrowns were shown to constitute a reliable approach 
      to restore severely damaged molars and premolars, even in the presence of
      extensive coronal tissue loss or occlusal risk factors, such as bruxism or
      unfavorable occlusal relationships. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Practitioners should
      consider the endocrown instead of the post and core approach to restore severely 
      damaged non-vital posterior teeth. This minimally invasive solution reduces the
      risk of catastrophic failures and is easily performed. The use of IDS procedure
      and lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic as prosthesis material gave very good
      results.

TI  - Effect of abutment tooth color, cement color, and ceramic thickness on the
      resulting optical color of a CAD/CAM glass-ceramic lithium disilicate-reinforced 
      crown.
PG  - 83-90
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(11)60004-8 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A dark-colored prepared abutment tooth may negatively
      affect the esthetic outcome of a ceramic restoration if the tooth is restored
      using translucent enamel-like ceramic materials. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the cumulative effect that the tooth abutment color, cement
      color, and ceramic thickness have on the resulting optical color of a CAD/CAM
      glass-ceramic lithium disilicate-reinforced crown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A
      CAD/CAM glass-ceramic lithium disilicate-reinforced monolithic crown (IPS e.max
      CAD LT) was fabricated. Three possible crown restoration variables were tested in
      vitro. The procedure examined 4 prepared abutment tooth colors (light, medium
      light, medium dark, and dark), 2 cement (Variolink II) colors (translucent and
      opaque), and 4 ceramic thickness values (1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, and 2.5 mm). The
      color of each combination was measured using a spectrophotometer, and the average
      values of the color difference (DeltaE) were calculated. The data were analyzed
      with a 3-way ANOVA (tooth abutment color, ceramic thickness, and luting agent)
      and Tukey's HSD test (alpha=.05), which evaluated within-group effects of the
      tooth abutment color to the DeltaE at each ceramic thickness. RESULTS: The DeltaE
      values of a CAD/CAM glass-ceramic lithium disilicate-reinforced crown were
      significantly influenced by the tooth abutment color (P<.001), cement color
      (P<.001), and ceramic thickness (P<.001). Significant interactions were present
      among these 3 variables (P<.001). A dark-colored abutment tooth demonstrated the 
      greatest DeltaE values relative to other variables tested. An increase in ceramic
      thickness resulted in a significant decrease in DeltaE values (P<.01). The DeltaE
      values were slightly decreased when the crowns were cemented using the opaque
      cement. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that underlying tooth abutment
      color, cement color, and ceramic thickness all influence the resulting optical
      color of CAD/CAM glass-ceramic lithium disilicate-reinforced restorations.

TI  - Full-mouth rehabilitation with monolithic CAD/CAM-fabricated hybrid and
      all-ceramic materials: A case report and 3-year follow up.
PG  - 115-21
LID - 10.3290/j.qi.a34808 [doi]
AB  - Esthetic full-mouth rehabilitation represents a great challenge for clinicians
      and dental technicians. Computer-aided design/ computer-assisted manufacture
      (CAD/CAM) technology and novel ceramic materials in combination with adhesive
      cementation provide a reliable, predictable, and economic workflow. Polychromatic
      feldspathic CAD/CAM ceramics that are specifically designed for anterior
      indications result in superior esthetics, whereas novel CAD/CAM hybrid ceramics
      provide sufficient fracture resistance and adsorption of the occlusal load in
      posterior areas. Screw-retained monolithic CAD/CAM lithium disilicate crowns (ie,
      hybrid abutment crowns) represent a reliable and time- and cost-efficient
      prosthetic implant solution. This case report details a CAD/CAM approach to the
      full-arch rehabilitation of a 65-year-old patient with toothand implant-supported
      restorations and provides an overview of the applied CAD/CAM materials and the
      utilized chairside intraoral scanner. The esthetics, functional occlusion, and
      gingival and peri-implant tissues remained stable over a follow-up period of 3
      years. No signs of fractures within the restorations were observed.

TI  - Effect of Crystallization Firing on Marginal Gap of CAD/CAM Fabricated Lithium
      Disilicate Crowns.
PG  - 63-66
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12638 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the marginal gaps of CAD/CAM (CEREC 3) produced crowns made 
      from leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic (IPS Empress CAD) blocks (LG), and
      lithium-disilicate (IPS e.max CAD) blocks before (LD-B), and after (LD-A)
      crystallization firing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A human molar tooth (#19) was
      mounted with adjacent teeth on a typodont and prepared for a full-coverage
      ceramic crown. The typodont was assembled in the mannequin head to simulate
      clinical conditions. After tooth preparation 15 individual optical impressions
      were taken by the same operator using titanium dioxide powder and a CEREC 3
      camera per manufacturer's instructions. One operator designed and machined the
      crowns in leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic blocks (n = 5) and lithium-disilicate 
      blocks (n = 10) using the CEREC 3 system. The crowns were rigidly seated on the
      prepared tooth, and marginal gaps (mum) were measured with an optical microscope 
      (500x) at 12 points, 3 on each of the M, B, D, and L surfaces of the
      leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic crowns and the lithium-disilicate crowns before 
      and after crystallization firing. Results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed
      by a Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: The
      overall mean marginal gaps (mum) for the crowns evaluated were: LG = 49.2 +/-
      5.5, LD-B = 42.9 +/- 12.2, and LD-A = 57.2 +/- 16.0. The marginal gaps for LG and
      LD-B were not significantly different, but both were significantly less than for 
      LD-A. CONCLUSIONS: The type of ceramic material did not affect the marginal gap
      of CAD/CAM crowns. The crystallization firing process required for
      lithium-disilicate crowns resulted in a significant increase in marginal gap
      size, likely due to shrinkage of the ceramic during the crystallization process. 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The marginal gap of CAD/CAM-fabricated lithium disilicate
      crowns increases following crystallization firing. The marginal gap still remains
      within clinically acceptable parameters.

TI  - Computer-aided designed/computer-assisted manufactured composite resin versus
      ceramic single-tooth restorations: a 3-year clinical study.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - PURPOSE: No clinical evidence has been provided to suggest that metal-free
      all-composite resin indirect restorations are a functional and esthetic
      alternative to all-ceramic restorations. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      the clinical performance of single-tooth computer-aided design/computer-assisted 
      manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-generated all-composite resin and all-ceramic crowns
      after 3 years of function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective trial, 200
      all-composite resin and all-ceramic crowns were rated over a 3-year period.
      Restorations were evaluated at 3 weeks and 1 and 3 years after insertion by the
      California Dental Association quality evaluation index, the patient's
      self-assessment, marginal fit, periodontal parameters, volume loss, and wear
      patterns of the veneering material. Statistical analysis was performed using t
      tests (a = .05). RESULTS: Cumulative survival and success rates after 3 years
      were 87.9% and 55.6% for all-composite resin and 97.2% and 81.2% for all-ceramic 
      crowns, respectively (P < .05 for success rates). Restoration loosening occurred 
      exclusively for all-composite resin crowns cemented on a cast post. All-ceramic
      restorations demonstrated satisfactory esthetic results. All-composite resin
      crowns resulted in significantly more mean total volume loss and mean vertical
      wear at occlusal contact areas after 6 months and 3 years of function. The
      clinical performance of the CAD/CAM-generated all-ceramic crowns used in this
      study was similar to that of other all-ceramic CAD/CAM systems. CONCLUSION: For
      up to 3 years of function, all-composite resin single-tooth restorations have
      inferior success rates compared to all-ceramic restorations. Due to the inferior 
      esthetics and wear resistance of all-composite resin crowns, all-ceramic crowns
      remain the preferred treatment for CAD/CAM-generated metal-free single-tooth
      restorations.

TI  - Fracture resistance of teeth restored with endocrowns: An in vitro study.
PG  - 389-394
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12549 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the fracture resistance and
      failure mode of endodontically treated teeth restored with lithium disilicate
      endocrowns of different crown thicknesses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30
      endodontically treated permanent mandibular first molars were sectioned
      horizontally 2 mm above the highest point of the cemento-enamel junction. The
      specimens were divided into three groups, and each group was restored with
      lithium disilicate (IPS e-max press) endocrowns of different crown thicknesses
      (3, 4.5, and 6 mm, respectively). After cementation, specimens were stored in
      room temperature for 72 hours, followed by subjecting them to compressive
      strength testing until failure. The fracture loads and the failure mode were
      recorded. Statistically analysis was performed using one-way analysis of
      variance. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in the
      fracture resistance between the three groups with the highest fracture resistance
      in the 3 mm group, followed by the 4.5 mm group, and the least in the 6 mm group 
      (P < .05). Most of the failures were accompanied with tooth fracture (90% in 3 mm
      group, 100% in 4.5 mm group, and 80% in 6 mm group). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the 
      crown thickness of the endocrowns reduced the fracture resistance of restored
      teeth. Minimum fracture loads for all teeth restored with endocrowns were
      significantly higher than the maximum occlusal forces reported in the literature.
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Fracture resistance and mode of failure of lithium
      disilicate (IPS e-max press) endocrowns varies widely between crown thicknesses. 
      Clinicians should be cautious with crown thickness for endocrown restorations.

TI  - Comparison of fracture strength of endocrowns and glass fiber post-retained
      conventional crowns.
PG  - 130-6
LID - 10.2341/11-105-L [doi]
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the fracture strength of full
      ceramic crowns using two techniques-indirect conventional crowns retained by
      glass fiber posts, and endocrowns with an ""anchorage"" in the pulp chamber-and
      analyze the failure mode. For this purpose, 20 healthy mandibular molars were
      divided into two groups (n=10): GroupGC contained teeth with indirect
      conventional crowns, filling cores, and glass fiber posts; Group GE contained
      teeth with restorations of the endocrown type. Teeth were endodontically treated 
      and prepared for ceramic restorations fabricated by the injection technique(IPS
      e.max Press, Ivoclar-Vivadent), forming the GC and GE groups. Specimens were
      mount-ed in a universal test machine (EMIC) and were submitted to an oblique
      compression load, at an angle of 135 degrees to the long axis of the tooth, until
      failure. Statistical evaluation performed by the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test 
      showed significant differences between the two groups (p=0.002), with Group GE
      shown to be more resistant to compressive forces than Group GC. The pre-dominant 
      failure pattern in both groups was fracture of the tooth on the side of force
      application and/or consequent displacement of the restoration on the opposite
      side.

TI  - Comparison of marginal fit between CAD-CAM and hot-press lithium disilicate
      crowns.

LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2018.03.035 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Hot-pressing and computer-aided design and computer-aided
      manufacturing (CAD-CAM) are major techniques for the fabrication of lithium
      disilicate crowns. They exhibit different accuracies regarding marginal fit, an
      important factor in restoration survival. However, studies comparing the marginal
      fit of different fabrication methods are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in
      vitro study was to compare the marginal discrepancy (MD) and absolute marginal
      discrepancy (AMD) of lithium disilicate crowns produced by the hot-press and
      CAD-CAM techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty typodont teeth were divided into
      2 groups. Fifteen teeth were scanned with the CEREC Omnicam intraoral scanner,
      and crowns were fabricated with the CEREC MC XL chairside CAD-CAM milling unit
      from IPS e.max CAD blocks. Fifteen typodont teeth were sent to a dental
      laboratory, and lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated from IPS e.max press
      ingots using the hot-press technique. The 30 crowns were cemented and then
      sectioned with a precision saw. The MD and AMD were measured for each crown with 
      a light microscope. One-way ANOVA was conducted to analyze significant
      differences in crown marginal fit between the fabrication systems (alpha=.05).
      RESULTS: For the CAD-CAM technique, the mean values of the AMD measurements were 
      115 mum, and for the hot-press technique, 130 mum. The MD measurements were 87
      mum for the CAD-CAM technique and 90 mum for the hot-press technique. One-way
      ANOVA revealed no significant differences between the fabrication methods
      regarding marginal fit (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were
      found between the fabrication methods tested. Both the CAD-CAM and hot-press
      techniques for producing monolithic lithium disilicate crowns produced MD values 
      of less than 120 mum, within the clinically acceptable range.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the marginal fit of zirconia and lithium 
      disilicate ceramic restorations processed by computer-aided design
      (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system. Materials and Methods: Ten
      models were prepared from a metal die, on which scanning was carried out to
      obtain the virtual model for the processing of zirconia and lithium disilicate
      ceramics using the CAD/CAM technique. Gypsum models were fabricated and used for 
      scanning the restorations. The infrastructures were designed using software, and 
      CAD/CAM was used to fabricate the restorations (n = 10). The analysis of the
      marginal discrepancy was measured at 12 points of the margin using the original
      metallic die. For each crown, an arithmetic average of the discrepancy values was
      obtained. Results: The marginal fit of the copings of lithium disilicate was
      133.10 +/- 26.87 mum and zirconia was 127.34 +/- 47.97 mum. There was no
      statistically significant difference (P = 0.7709) between the materials.
      Conclusion: The marginal fit is similar between lithium disilicate and zirconia
      ceramics milled in the CAD/CAM system used.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of restoration design ('2.5-mm deep
      endocrown', '5-mm deep endocrown' or '5-mm deep post&crown') and CAD/CAM material
      type (composite or lithium disilicate glass-ceramic) on the load-to-failure of
      endodontically treated premolars in absence of any ferrule. METHODS: The crowns
      of 48 single-rooted premolars were cut and the roots were endodontically treated.
      Teeth were randomly divided into six groups (n=8); teeth in each group were
      restored using one of the two tested materials with standardized CAD/CAM
      fabricated endocrowns (with either 2.5-mm or 5-mm deep intra-radicular extension)
      or conventional crowns (5-mm deep post&crown). After cementation using luting
      composite, the specimens were immersed in distilled water and subjected to
      1,200,000 chewing cycles with a load of 50N applied parallel to the long axis of 
      the tooth (0 degrees ). After cyclic loading, a compressive load was applied at
      45 degrees to the tooth's long axis using a universal testing machine until
      failure. Load-to-failure was recorded (N) and the specimens were examined under a
      stereomicroscope with 3.5x magnification to determine the mode of failure.
      RESULTS: All specimens survived the 1,200,000 chewing cycles. A significant
      interaction between restoration design and CAD/CAM material was found using
      two-way ANOVA. In the '2.5-mm deep endocrown' groups, the composite achieved a
      significantly higher load-to-failure than the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic,
      while no differences between materials were found in the '5-mm deep endocrown'
      and '5-mm deep post&crown' groups. More unfavorable failures (root fractures)
      were observed for higher load-to-failure values. CONCLUSIONS: Only following a
      '2.5-mm deep endocrown' design, composite appeared more favorable than lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic as crown material; this may be explained by their
      difference in elastic modulus. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Shallow endocrown
      preparations on premolars present less surface for adhesive luting and a
      difference in crown material becomes apparent in terms of load-to-failure. The
      use of a more flexible composite crown material appeared then a better option.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Long-term clinical data on the survival of pressed lithium 
      disilicate glass-ceramic when used with partial coverage restorations and the
      effect that different technical and clinical variables have on survival are
      sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical study was to determine the
      10.9-year survival of pressed lithium disilicate glass-ceramic partial coverage
      restorations and associated clinical parameters on outcomes. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Individuals requiring single unit defect-specific partial coverage
      restorations in any area of the mouth were recruited in a clinical private
      practice. Participants were offered the options of partial coverage cast gold or 
      glass-ceramic (lithium disilicate) restorations. Only participants that chose
      glass-ceramic partial coverage restorations were included in the study. The
      overall survival of the glass-ceramic restorations was assessed by the clinical
      factors (participant's age, sex, dental arch, tooth position in dental arch, type
      of partial coverage restoration, and ceramic thickness) determined at recall. The
      effect of this clinical parameters was evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier survival
      curves accounting for attrition bias and other reasons for failure. The
      statistical significance of differences between parameters was determined by
      using the log rank test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: A total of 304 participants
      requiring 556 lithium disilicate restorations were evaluated. The mean age for
      the participant at the time of restoration placement was 62 with a range of 20 to
      99 years, 120 were men and 184 were women. A total of 6 failures (bulk fracture
      or large chip) requiring replacement were recorded with the average time to
      failure of 2.4 (0.8-9.2) years. The total time at risk computed for these units
      was 1978.9 years providing an estimated failure risk of 0.3% per year. The
      10-year estimated cumulative survival was 95.6%. The estimated cumulative
      survival of inlays (n=246) and onlays (n=305) were 93.9% and 98.3%, at 9.9 and
      9.8 years, respectively (P<.05). Of the 6, there were 3 failures recorded for the
      partial coverage inlay restorations. The total time at risk for these inlays was 
      786.79 years providing an estimated risk of 0.38% per year. The other 3 failures 
      recorded occurred for the partial coverage onlay restorations. The total time at 
      risk for the onlays was 1032.17 years providing an estimated risk of 0.29% per
      year. The failures occurred in the molar region only. There were no failures
      recorded for the anterior partial coverage inlays (n=5). The total time at risk
      computed for the anterior units was 21.55 years providing an estimated risk of 0%
      per year. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival of
      partial coverage restorations among men and women, different age groups, or
      position in the dental arch. The thickness of the restoration had no influence on
      the survival of glass-ceramic partial coverage restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Pressed
      lithium disilicate defect-specific partial coverage restorations reported high
      survival rate over the 10.9-year period with an overall failure rate of 0.3% per 
      year and limited to the molar teeth. Risk of failure at any age was minimal for
      both men and women.

      follow up.
PG  - 290-7
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(09)60176-1 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD/CAM) titanium ceramic restorations were developed with the potential for
      replacing expensive, high noble metal ceramic restorations. However, there is a
      lack of information about the clinical performance of CAD/CAM titanium ceramic
      single crowns. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate CAD/CAM
      titanium ceramic single crowns after 3 years in function. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A
      total of 41 crowns were fabricated for 21 patients. The titanium copings were
      CAD/CAM milled (Everest CAD/CAM system) with an even thickness of 0.5 mm, and
      low-fusing veneering porcelain (Vita Titanium Porcelain) was added incrementally.
      The crowns were cemented using zinc phosphate cement after confirming that there 
      were no mechanical and biological complications. The patients were recalled at
      12, 24, and 36 months after cementation to examine the presence of any
      complications and measure periodontal parameters such as probing depth (PD),
      bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque index (PI). The success and survival rates 
      were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The success rate of
      CAD/CAM titanium ceramic crowns with regard to mechanical complications was 82.3%
      (95% confidence interval: 71.2% to 95.1%). The cumulative survival rate of the
      crowns was 94.9% (95% confidence interval: 88.3% to 100%) after 3 years. No
      biological complications were observed. At the end of the follow up, PD was 2.93 
      mm, percentile of surface with BOP was 29.2, and PI was 0.31. CONCLUSIONS: The
      clinical performances of the CAD/CAM titanium ceramic crowns for 3 years were
      acceptable, with no biologic complications and a high cumulative survival rate.

AB  - Advances in computer-aided design (CAD) / computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)
      technologies and their ease of application enabled the development of novel
      treatment concepts for modern prosthodontics. This recent paradigm shift in fixed
      prosthodontics from traditional to minimally invasive treatment approaches is
      evidenced by the clinical long-term success of bonded CAD/CAM glass-ceramic
      restorations. Today, defect-oriented restorations, such as inlays, onlays, and
      posterior crowns, are predominately fabricated from glass-ceramics in monolithic 
      application. The variety of CAD/CAM ceramic restorative systems is constantly
      evolving to meet the increased demands for highly aesthetic, biocompatible, and
      long-lasting restorations. Recently introduced polymer-infiltrated ceramic
      network CAD/CAM blocks add innovative treatment options in CAD/CAM chairside
      1-visit restorations. The material-specific high-edge stability enables the
      CAD/CAM machinability of thin restoration margins. Full-contour zirconia
      restorations are constantly gaining market share at the expense of bilayered
      systems. Advancements in material science and bonding protocols foster the
      development of novel material combinations or fabrication techniques of proven
      high-strength zirconia ceramics. CAD/CAM applications offer a standardized
      manufacturing process resulting in a reliable, predictable, and economic workflow
      for individual and complex teeth-supported restorations. More evidence from
      long-term clinical studies is needed to verify the clinical performance of
      monolithic polymer-infiltrated ceramic network and zirconia teeth-supported
      minimally invasive and extensive restorations.

LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.09.048 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The clinical success of monolithic lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic (LDGC) crowns manufactured with computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology provided by predoctoral
      students has not been fully investigated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      retrospective clinical study was to evaluate the performance of
      laboratory-fabricated monolithic posterior LDGC CAD-CAM crowns provided by
      predoctoral students at the University of Toronto. Specific patient- and
      provider-related factors were also investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample
      of posterior LDGC CAD-CAM crowns (IPS e.max) provided by predoctoral students was
      evaluated. Crown preparations were made according to specific criteria, and
      crowns were milled in an in-house laboratory by using the CEREC Bluecam system.
      The crowns were cemented with Rely-X Unicem (3M ESPE) and Calibra Universal
      (Dentsply Sirona) resin cements. Clinical assessments of the crowns and
      supporting periodontal structures were performed following the modified
      California Dental Association (CDA) criteria. Intraoral photographs and
      periapical and bitewing radiographs were obtained for further assessment by 2
      evaluators. Descriptive statistics, McNemar, t test, log rank (Mantel-Cox) tests,
      Pearson chi-squared tests, simple logistic regression, odds ratios, and Kaplan
      Meier survival analyses were performed (alpha=.05). RESULTS: A total of 189
      patients receiving 210 crowns (108 premolar and 102 molar) were examined with a
      follow-up period of up to 6 years. Altogether, 28 complications were observed (12
      technical, 11 biological, and 5 esthetic). No significant association was found
      between patient age, sex, periodontal condition, tooth type, tooth vitality,
      cement type, and crown longevity. However, significantly lower survival and
      success rates were found for mandibular crowns than for maxillary crowns
      (P=.029). The provider's experience had no significant effect on the clinical
      performance of LDGC CAD-CAM crowns. The 6-year cumulative survival rate was
      93.0%, and the success rate was 86.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The ease of use of the
      CAD-CAM system and clinical performance of LDGC suggest that this technology
      should be used in the dental school setting by predoctoral students.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Different techniques are used to fabricate complete
      coverage restorations. Each fabrication technique requires a specific preparation
      design that may violate a principle of tooth preparation, that is, conservation
      of tooth structure. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare
      the volume of loss of mandibular first molar structure associated with a
      preparation for computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) 
      versus conventionally fabricated complete coverage restorations. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Fifty artificial mandibular right first molars were weighed before and
      after preparation for complete coverage restorations of the following types:
      complete cast, monolithic zirconia, monolithic pressed lithium disilicate,
      monolithic milled lithium disilicate, and metal-ceramic crowns (n=10 per method).
      Tooth mass loss was measured by subtracting the mass after preparation from the
      mass before the preparation, and tooth volume loss was calculated by dividing the
      mass by the density of the material. A robust analysis of variance (ANOVA),
      followed by a post hoc test, was used to compare the volume of tooth loss
      (alpha=.01). RESULTS: Mean tooth volume losses were 255.6 mm(3), 270.0 mm(3),
      312.7 mm(3), 331.7 mm(3), and 309.9 mm(3) for complete cast, monolithic zirconia,
      monolithic pressed lithium disilicate, monolithic milled lithium disilicate, and 
      metal-ceramic crowns, respectively. Teeth prepared for monolithic CAD-CAM
      zirconia and lithium disilicate crowns did not exhibit a significantly lower
      (P>.01) decrease in volume loss than with complete cast and monolithic pressed
      lithium crowns. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation of teeth for monolithic CAD-CAM complete
      coverage restorations is not associated with a significantly higher volume of
      tooth loss than their conventionally fabricated counterpart preparations.

TI  - A clinical evaluation of chairside lithium disilicate CAD/CAM crowns: a two-year 
      report.
PG  - 10S-4S
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developments in ceramic material science have led to improvements in 
      the physical properties of modern ceramics, leading to a substantial increase in 
      the clinical use of all-ceramic restorations. The authors evaluated the clinical 
      performance of lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent, Amherst,
      N.Y.) all-ceramic crowns. METHODS: The authors fabricated 62 lithium disilicate
      crowns with a chairside computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD/CAM) system (CEREC 3, Sirona Dental Systems, Charlotte, N.C.) and cemented
      them with two types of adhesive resin cements. Two examiners used modified U.S.
      Public Health Service criteria to evaluate the crowns at baseline, six months,
      one year and two years. RESULTS: There were no clinically identified cases of
      crown fracture or surface chipping. There was no reported sensitivity at one or
      two years with either cement. For margin discoloration, the percentage Alfa score
      was 86.9 percent for crowns cemented with a self-etching, dual-curing cement. All
      other percentage Alfa scores were greater than 92.0 percent, indicating no
      appreciable change in the crowns during the two-year study. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results show that lithium disilicate crowns performed well after two years of
      clinical service. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Early results indicate that monolithic
      lithium disilicate CAD/CAM crowns may be an effective option for all-ceramic
      crowns.

TI  - Preparation Ferrule Design Effect on Endocrown Failure Resistance.
PG  - e237-e242
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12671 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of preparation ferrule inclusion with fracture
      resistance of mandibular molar endocrowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recently
      extracted mandibular third molars were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 12)
      with the coronal tooth structure removed perpendicular to the root long axis
      approximately 2 mm above the cemento-enamel junction with a slow-speed diamond
      saw. The pulp chamber was exposed using a diamond bur in a high-speed handpiece
      with pulpal remnants removed and canals instrumented using endodontic hand
      instruments. The chamber floor was restored using a resin core material with a
      two-step, self-etch adhesive and photopolymerized with a visible light-curing
      unit to create a 2 mm endocrown preparation pulp chamber extension. One and two
      millimeter ferrule height groups were prepared using a diamond bur in a
      high-speed handpiece following CAD/CAM guidelines. Completed preparation surface 
      area was determined using a digital measuring microscope. Scanned preparations
      were restored with lithium disilicate restorations with a self-adhesive resin
      luting agent. All manufacturer recommendations were followed. Specimens were
      stored at 37 degrees C/98% humidity and tested to failure after 24 hours at a 45 
      degrees angle to the tooth long axis using a universal testing machine. Failure
      load was converted to MPa using the available bonding surface area with mean data
      analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Calculated failure stress
      found no difference in failure resistance among the three groups; however,
      failure load results identified that the endocrown preparations without ferrule
      had significantly lower fracture load resistance. Failure mode analysis
      identified that all preparations demonstrated a high number of catastrophic
      failures. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, ferrule-containing
      endocrown preparations demonstrated significantly greater failure loads than
      standard endocrown restorations; however, calculated failure stress based on
      available surface area for adhesive bonding found no difference between the
      groups. Lower instances of catastrophic failure were observed with the endocrown 
      preparations containing 1 mm of preparation ferrule design; however, regardless
      of the presence of ferrule, this study found that all endocrown restorations
      suffered a high proportion of catastrophic failures but at loads greater than
      reported under normal masticatory function.

TI  - Evaluation of the fracture resistance of computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing monolithic crowns prepared in different cement thicknesses.
PG  - 417-422
LID - 10.4103/njcp.njcp_137_17 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance
      of monolithic computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) crowns
      that are prepared with different cement thickness. Materials and Methods: For
      this investigation, a human maxillary premolar tooth was selected. Master model
      preparation was performed with a demand bur under water spray. Master die was
      taken to fabricate 105 epoxy resin replicas. The crowns were milled using a CEREC
      4 CAD/CAM system (Software Version, 4.2.0.57192). CAD/CAM crowns were made using 
      resin nanoceramic, feldspathic glass ceramic, lithium disilicate, and
      leucite-reinforced ceramics. Each group was subdivided into three groups in
      accordance with three different cement thicknesses (30, 90, and 150 mum). Crowns 
      milled out. Then RelyX() U200 was used as a luting agent to bond the crowns to
      the prepared samples. After one hour cementations, the specimens were stored in
      water bath at 37 degrees C for 1 week before testing. Seven unprepared and
      unrestored teeth were kept and tested as a control group. A universal test
      machine was used to assume the fracture resistance of all specimens. The
      compressive load (N) that caused fracture was recorded for each specimen.
      Fracture resistance data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA and
      two-factor interaction modeling test (alpha = 0.001). Results: There are
      statistically significant differences between fracture resistances of CAD/CAM
      monolithic crown materials (P < 0.001). It is seen that cement thickness is not
      statistically significant for fracture resistance of CAD/CAM monolithic crowns (P
      > 0.001). Conclusions: CAD/CAM monolithic crown materials affected fracture
      resistance. Cement thickness (30, 90, and 150 mum) was not effective on fracture 
      resistance of CAD/CAM monolithic crowns.

      CAD/CAM materials under axial and lateral loading.
PG  - 378-387
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12486 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the fracture
      resistance and failure modes of endocrowns made of three computer-aided
      design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials subjected to
      thermo-mechanical cycling loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty mandibular
      molars were divided into four groups (n = 20): one (C E) was restored with
      lithium disilicate glass-ceramic conventional crowns, three were restored with
      endocrowns made of three different CAD/CAM materials; (E E) lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic, (E V) zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic, and (E
      C) resin nano-ceramic. After cycling loading, half of the samples from each group
      were loaded axially and the other half was loaded laterally. Fracture resistance 
      was recorded in Newton (N) and failure modes were classified. Two-way ANOVA,
      Bonferroni post hoc (alpha = .05), Chi-square, and multiple logistic regression
      tests were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Statistically significant interaction
      were recorded between fracture resistance (N) and loading (P < .001), and groups 
      (conventuional crown and endocrowns; P < .001). Endocrowns presented higher
      fracture strength than conventional crowns. Fracture resistance was significantly
      larger under axial loading. The numbers of irreparable failures were extremely
      important in the endocrowns groups (Groups E E, E V, E C), and only conventional 
      crowns (Group C E) showed almost no irreparable failures under axial loading.
      CONCLUSION: Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic recorded the highest fracture
      resistance under axial and lateral loading. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The number of 
      irreparable failures with all endocrown materials tested do not suggest yet the
      use of this type of restorations in posterior teeth.

LID - 10.21815/JDE.019.173 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the convergence angles of posterior
      teeth prepared by dental students at the University of Toronto for lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic (LDGC) CAD/CAM crowns and to investigate their effect on
      loss of retention rate. A total of 280 preparations for posterior monolithic LDGC
      CAD/CAM crowns were performed on 270 patients (169 women and 101 men). Crowns
      were cemented with RelyX Unicem and Calibra Universal resin cements. Mesial,
      distal, and angle of convergence were measured on the bitewing radiographs.
      Cemented crowns were followed for up to six years. Data were analyzed for tooth
      type and location and for operator experience. The results showed the majority of
      convergence angles were greater than the recommended guidelines but fell within a
      clinically acceptable range (20 to 24 degrees). However, angles of convergence
      for mandibular molar preparations were highest (28.06+/-5.50 degrees), while
      maxillary premolars exhibited the lowest values (24.72+/-6.59 degrees). No
      significant difference was found between the results of dental students and
      foreign-trained dentists. Over a six-year observation period, only two crowns
      lost retention. The findings of this study indicated that ideal taper angles were
      impractical and difficult to achieve in clinical education settings.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic review was to compare implant prostheses
      fabricated by computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing
      (CAD/CAM) with conventionally fabricated implant prostheses when assessing
      esthetics, complications (biologic and mechanical), patient satisfaction, and
      economic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic searches for clinical studies
      focusing on long-term follow-up were performed using the PubMed and Ovid search
      engines. Concentrating on the restorative aspect of the CAD/CAM technology
      applicable to implant dentistry, pertinent literature was divided into articles
      related to implant abutments, crowns, and frameworks. RESULTS: A total of 18
      articles satisfied the inclusion criteria. Two articles reported on CAD/CAM
      crowns, six on abutments, and 10 on implant-supported CAD/CAM frameworks. The
      mean survival rate for CAD/CAM crowns was 98.85% and for CAD/CAM abutments 100%. 
      The mean survival rate for CAD/CAM frameworks was 95.98%. CONCLUSION: Based on
      the current literature, CAD/CAM fabricated crowns, abutments, and frameworks
      demonstrate survival rates comparable to conventionally fabricated prostheses.
      Implant survival appears unaffected by fabrication technique. Since this
      technology encompasses several manufacturing variations, a new definition might
      be necessary to accurately define the processes under which the CAD/CAM
      restorations are fabricated. ""Complete CAD/CAM product"" where no or minimal
      manual intervention is employed could be a possible term.

LID - 10.1111/jopr.12964 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine and compare the microstructure, flexural strength, flexural
      modulus, fracture strength, and microhardness of four types of computer-aided
      design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials for monolithic dental
      restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A lithium disilicate (LD; IPS e.max CAD), a 
      zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS; VITA Suprinity), a hybrid
      high-performance polymer (HPP) composite resin (GC Cerasmart), and a hybrid
      polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) material (VITA Enamic) were used to
      manufacture monolithic ceramic posterior crowns (n = 10) that were adhesively
      cemented on resin-based composite dies and loaded until fracture. In addition, 40
      rectangular bars (n = 10) were milled and polished for three-point flexural
      strength testing. Microhardness (Vickers indentation), as well as quantitative
      (energy dispersive spectroscopy) and qualitative (scanning electron microscopy)
      structural analysis were conducted on fracture surfaces. Data were analyzed by
      one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post-hoc test (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Mechanical testing
      results showed that the material type has a significant effect on the fracture
      strength (p < 0.0001) of the monolithic crowns with ZLS and LD presenting
      significantly higher fracture strength than the PICN and HPP hybrid materials. LD
      showed the highest flexural strength (p < 0.0001) followed by ZLS, HPP, and PICN,
      respectively. The lowest flexural modulus and hardness were presented by HPP
      whereas ZLS had the highest flexural modulus and hardness. The LD presented the
      highest modulus of resilience and the PICN the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: All CAD/CAM
      crown materials exhibited high values of fracture and flexural resistance, making
      them suitable materials for posterior full-crown restorations. Glass-ceramics
      suffered more from catastrophic and nonreparable fracture patterns, whereas
      minimal chipping and type II fracture patterns were more common in hybrid
      materials. The combination of more flexibility, less stiffness, and increased
      softness with satisfactory flexural and fracture strength values observed in PICN
      and HPP makes these two hybrid materials suitable choices for chairside
      monolithic crown fabrication.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Single-tooth implant restorations are commonly used to
      replace anterior maxillary teeth. The esthetic, functional, and biologic outcomes
      are, in part, a function of the abutment and crown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 
      clinical study was to describe the implant, abutment, and crown survival and
      complication rates for CAD/CAM zirconia abutment and lithium disilicate crown
      restorations for single-tooth implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As part of a
      broader prospective investigation that enrolled and treated 141 participants
      comparing tissue responses at the conical interface (CI; AstraTech OsseoSpeed),
      flat-to-flat interface (FI; NobelSpeedy), and platform-switch interface (PS;
      NanoTite Certain Prevail) of single-tooth implants, computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) zirconia abutments (ATLANTIS Abutment) and
      cemented lithium disilicate (e.max) crowns were used in the restoration of all
      implants. After 2.4 years in function (3 years after implant placement), the
      implant, abutment, and crown of 110 participants were evaluated. Technical and
      biologic complications were recorded. Demographic results were tabulated as
      percentages with mean values and standard deviations. Abutment survival was
      calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: After 2.4 years, no abutments
      or crowns had been lost. Abutment complications (screw loosening, screw fracture,
      fracture) were absent for all 3 implant groups. Crown complications were limited 
      to 2 crowns debonding and 1 with excess cement (2.5%). Five biological
      complications (4.0%) were recorded. The overall complication rate was 6.5%.
      CONCLUSIONS: CAD/CAM zirconia abutments restored with cemented lithium disilicate
      crowns demonstrated high survival on 3 different implant-abutment interface
      designs. No abutment or abutment screw fracture occurred. The technical
      complications observed after 2.4 years were minor and reversible. The use of
      CAD/CAM zirconia abutments with cemented lithium disilicate crowns is associated 
      with high technical and biologic success at 2.4 years.

AB  - Resin-based composite molar crowns made by computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems have been proposed as an inexpensive alternative 
      to metal-ceramic or all-ceramic crowns. However, there is a lack of scientific
      information regarding fatigue resistance. This study aimed to analyze the fatigue
      behavior of CAD/CAM resin-based composite compared with lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic. One-hundred and sixty bar-shaped specimens were fabricated using
      resin-based composite blocks [Lava Ultimate (LU); 3M/ESPE] and lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic [IPS e.max press (EMP); Ivoclar/Vivadent]. The specimens were
      divided into four groups: no treatment (NT); thermal cycling (TC); mechanical
      cycling (MC); and thermal cycling followed by mechanical cycling (TCMC). Thermal 
      cycling was performed by alternate immersion in water baths of 5 degrees C and 55
      degrees C for 5 x 10(4) cycles. Mechanical cycling was performed in a three-point
      bending test, with a maximum load of 40 N, for 1.2 x 10(6) cycles. In addition,
      LU and EMP molar crowns were fabricated and subjected to fatigue treatments
      followed by load-to-failure testing. The flexural strength of LU was not severely
      reduced by the fatigue treatments. The fatigue treatments did not significantly
      affect the fracture resistance of LU molar crowns. The results demonstrate the
      potential of clinical application of CAD/CAM-generated resin-based composite
      molar crowns in terms of fatigue resistance.

AB  - Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) restorative
      materials have been widely used owing to a number of advantages, including stable
      quality of the materials, lower costs, and time-saving factors. Resin-based
      CAD/CAM materials for definitive restorations are classified into two groups:
      dispersed nanoparticle-filled composite resin and
      polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network materials. Resin-based CAD/CAM materials have
      been applied to single crown restorations as a monolithic structure for the
      posterior region. In addition, resin-based CAD/CAM restorations have been applied
      recently for the anterior area. This literature review summarizes clinical
      outcomes, such as survival rates and clinical complications of single crown
      restorations fabricated with resin-based CAD/CAM materials.

TI  - Strength and fracture pattern of monolithic CAD/CAM-generated posterior crowns.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the strength and fracture pattern of monolithic 
      posterior CAD/CAM crowns hypothesizing that zinc-phosphate cemented lithium
      disilicate crowns might show the same fracture strength as adhesively cemented
      crowns. METHODS: Two sets of monolithic posterior crowns each with uniform
      occlusal and lateral wall thickness of 1.5mm were fabricated from three types of 
      block ceramic (1) lithium disilicate glass, (2) leucite glass and (3) feldspathic
      ceramic using CEREC 3 CAD/CAM. Crowns (n = 15) of ceramics (1), (2) and (3) each 
      were (A) zinc-phosphate cemented, (B) adhesively cemented on resin-based
      composite dies and loaded until fracture. Load data was analyzed using ANOVA and 
      Scheffe tests. Crack pattern was evaluated on an additional three sample
      cross-sections for each group at start of fracture. RESULTS: Radial cracks
      originated early at the cementation interfaces and cone cracks were observed
      finally at the loading sites. Mean load values (SD) of A-crowns at fracture
      start/end (1) 807 (91) N/2082 (192) N; (2) 915 (193) N/1130 (166) N; (3) 985
      (199) N/1270 (301) N were all significantly (P < 0.001) lower when compared to
      their B-crown analogs (1) 1456 (205) N/2389 (84) N; (2) 1684 (395) N/2469 (171)
      N; (3) 1548 (304) N/2392 (75) N, rejecting the authors hypothesis. A-1 crowns had
      significantly (P < 0.001) higher fracture load than A-2 and A-3 crowns. The A-1
      crown fracture load data, even if significantly (P < 0.001) lower, came close to 
      the B-1 values. SIGNIFICANCE: Adhesive cementation balanced the strength of weak 
      ceramics with that of strong ceramic and recommended itself for leucite glass
      ceramic and feldspathic ceramic crowns. Zinc-phosphate cementation appeared
      feasible for lithium disilicate crowns.

AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the effect of two processing techniques (pressing and
      CAD/CAM - Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Machining) of lithium-disilicate
      (LD) based crowns on the microstructure, topography, roughness, fractal
      dimension, internal and marginal adaptation. METHODS: One-hundred identical
      preparations for monolithic crowns were made with dentin analogue material (G10
      epoxy resin). One of the preparations was scanned and a monolithic crown in
      lithium-disilicate was planned in the CAD system. Fifty crowns were milled in a
      wax pattern and subjected to pressing (IPS e.max Press), while 50 crowns were
      machined at CAD/CAM (IPS e.max CAD) and posteriorly crystallized. Internal and
      marginal adaptation were assessed via replica technique at four manufacturing
      moments (Milled wax pattern; LD(PRESS); Milled LD(CAD); Crystallized LD(CAD)) and
      considering 5 regions (margin, cervico-axial angle, axial wall, axial-occlusal
      angle and occlusal wall). Complementary analysis considering microstructure and
      topography, roughness and fractal dimension were performed in Scanning Electron
      Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). RESULTS: The processing
      technique resulted in different ceramic microstructure, topography, roughness and
      fractal dimension, whereas CAD/CAM lead to smoother, more homogeneous but more
      complex topography features (higher fractal dimension) in comparison to the
      pressing technique (P<0.05). Regarding marginal and internal fit, LD(PRESS)
      crowns showed to be more adapted at the margin, while LD(CAD) were more adapted
      at the occluso-axial angle; other regions were not statistically different
      (alpha=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CAD/CAM and the pressing techniques for manufacturing 
      LD crowns lead to completely different ceramic surface characteristics and affect
      crown adaptation at the margin and at occluso-axial angle.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the fracture strength of
      endocrowns made of lithium disilicate ceramic and two different indirect resin
      composites. Materials and Methods: Forty human mandibular molars were randomly
      separated into four groups (n = 10 in each group) - Group IN: control group,
      Group IPS: endocrowns made of lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max CAD,
      IvoclarVivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein); Group SL: Endocrowns made of Solidex
      microhybrid composite (Shofu, Ratingen, Germany); and Group GR: Endocrowns made
      of Grandia microhybrid composite (GC Europa, Leuven, Belgium). In all of the
      groups, dual-cure resin cement (Relyx Ultimate Clicker, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN,
      USA) was used to cement the endocrowns. All of the teeth were subjected to
      fracture by means of a universal testing machine (Instron), and compressive force
      was applied. The failure type and location after fracture were classified. The
      data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc test, and Chi-square
      test (P < 0.05). Results: Group IPS showed significantly higher fracture strength
      than Groups SL and GR (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the
      SL and GR groups (P > 0.05). In Group SL, 80% of the specimens exhibited
      favorable fractures; also, 60% of the specimens exhibited favorable fracture in
      group GR, and only 10% of the specimens exhibited favorable fracture in group
      IPS. Conclusions: The lithium disilicate ceramic endocrowns exhibited higher
      fracture resistance than indirect composite groups. Both of the composite
      endocrowns showed more favorable failure than the lithium disilicate ceramic
      endocrowns.

TI  - Single crowns with CAD/CAM-fabricated copings from titanium: 6-year clinical
      results.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD/CAM) titanium ceramic restorations were developed with the potential for
      replacing expensive, high noble metal ceramic restorations. However, little
      information exists about the clinical performance of CAD/CAM titanium ceramic
      single crowns. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate CAD/CAM
      titanium ceramic single crowns after 6 years in function. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A
      total of 41 crowns were fabricated for 21 patients. The titanium copings were
      CAD/CAM milled (Everest CAD/CAM system), with an even thickness of 0.5 mm and
      veneered with low-fusing porcelain (Vita Titanium Porcelain) in the
      powder-build-up technique. All the crowns were cemented with zinc phosphate. The 
      participants were recalled at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months after cementation
      to document any mechanical and biologic complications and to measure the
      periodontal parameters, such as probing depth, bleeding on probing, and the
      plaque index. The success and survival rates were calculated according to the
      Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: After 6 years of clinical service, 12 mechanical 
      complications and 1 biologic complication were found, which resulted in a success
      rate of 67.8%. The cumulative survival rate of the crowns was 91.3% after 6
      years. At the end of the follow-up period, the probing depth was 3.21 mm, the
      percentile of surface with bleeding on probing was 25, and the plaque index was
      0.37. No secondary caries or decementation was detected during the 6-year
      observation period. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical performance of the CAD/CAM
      titanium-ceramic crowns after 6 years was poor because of veneering porcelain
      problems. Recent CAD software with tools to design proper copings might improve
      the clinical success.

AB  - PURPOSE: Ceramics are widely used as indirect restorative materials in dentistry 
      because of their high biocompatibility and pleasing aesthetics. The objective is 
      to review the state of the arts of CAD/CAM all-ceramic biomaterials. STUDY
      SELECTION: CAD/CAM all-ceramic biomaterials are highlighted and a subsequent
      literature search was conducted for the relevant subjects using PubMed followed
      by manual search. RESULTS: Developments in CAD/CAM technology have catalyzed
      researches in all-ceramic biomaterials and their applications. Feldspathic glass 
      ceramic and glass infiltrated ceramic can be fabricated by traditional laboratory
      methods or CAD/CAM. The advent of polycrystalline ceramics is a direct result of 
      CAD/CAM technology without which the fabrication would not have been possible.
      CONCLUSIONS: The clinical uses of these ceramics have met with variable clinical 
      success. Multiple options are now available to the clinicians for the fabrication
      of aesthetic all ceramic restorations.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The accuracy of chairside computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) restorations is questionable, and the
      effect of the die spacer settings is not well stated in the literature. PURPOSE: 
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the marginal and internal adaptation of 
      E4D crowns fabricated with different spacer thicknesses and to compare these
      crowns with those fabricated with the heat-press technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      The E4D system was used to fabricate 30 crowns for the first 3 groups, with
      different spacer thickness settings: 30 mum, 60 mum, and 100 mum. In the fourth
      group, 10 lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated with the heat-press
      technique. The occlusal gap, axial gap, vertical marginal gap, and absolute
      marginal discrepancy were evaluated by x-ray microtomography. Statistical
      significance was assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test (alpha=.05). For post hoc 
      analyses, the Mann-Whitney U test was used alongside the Bonferroni correction
      for multiple comparisons (alpha=.008). RESULTS: Within the CAD/CAM groups, the
      30-mum spacer thickness resulted in the lowest median axial gap (90.04 mum),
      whereas the 60-mum spacer thickness resulted in the lowest median occlusal gap
      (152.39 mum). The median marginal gap values of the CAD/CAM-60 group (49.35 mum) 
      and CAD/CAM-100 group (46.65 mum) were lower than those of the CAD/CAM-30 group
      (55.18 mum). No significant differences among the CAD/CAM groups were observed
      for absolute marginal discrepancy. The heat-press group had significantly
      different values than those of the CAD/CAM groups. CONCLUSION: The spacer
      thickness and fabrication technique affected the adaptation of ceramic crowns.
      The heat-press group yielded the best marginal and internal crown adaptation
      results. The 30- or 60-mum spacer settings are recommended for the E4D CAD/CAM
      system.

TI  - Influence of Adhesive Core Buildup Designs on the Resistance of Endodontically
      Treated Molars Restored With Lithium Disilicate CAD/CAM Crowns.
PG  - 76-82
LID - 10.2341/14-277-L [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of adhesive core buildup designs (4-mm
      buildup, 2-mm buildup, and no buildup/endocrown) on the fatigue resistance and
      failure mode of endodontically treated molar teeth restored with lithium
      disilicate computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) complete 
      crowns placed with self-adhesive cement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-five
      extracted molars were decoronated at the level of the cementoenamel junction and 
      endodontically treated. Specimens received different Filtek Z100 adhesive core
      buildups (4-mm buildup; 2-mm buildup; and no buildup endocrown preparation) and
      were restored with Cerec 3 CAD/CAM lithium disilicate crowns (IPS e.max CAD). The
      intaglio surfaces of restorations (n=15) were conditioned by hydrofluoric acid
      etching and silane, and prepared teeth were treated with airborne-particle
      abrasion, followed by cementation with RelyX Unicem 2 Automix. Specimens were
      then subjected to cyclic isometric loading at 10 Hz, beginning with a load of 200
      N (x5000 cycles), followed by stages of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 N at 
      a maximum of 30,000 cycles each. Specimens were loaded until failure or to a
      maximum of 185,000 cycles. The chewing cycle was simulated by an isometric
      contraction (load control) applied through a 10-mm in diameter composite resin
      sphere (Filtek Z100). Surviving specimens were axially loaded until failure or to
      a maximum load of 4500 N (crosshead speed 0.5 mm/min). The failure mode was
      assessed, and fractures were designated as catastrophic (tooth/root fracture that
      would require tooth extraction) or reparable (cohesive or cohesive/adhesive
      fracture of restoration only). Groups were compared using the life table survival
      analysis (log-rank test at p=0.05). Surviving specimens were loaded to failure
      and compared with one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: The survival rates after
      the fatigue test were 100%, 93%, and 100% for 4-mm, 2-mm, and no buildup
      (endocrown), respectively and were not statistically different (only one specimen
      failed with a 2-mm buildup under a crown that cohesively fractured at 1,400 N).
      Postfatigue load to failure averaged 3181 N for 4-mm buildups (15 specimens),
      3759 N for 2-mm buildups (12 specimens), and 3265 N for endocrowns (14
      specimens). The 2-mm buildups were associated with higher loads to failure than
      endocrowns and 4-mm buildups, but no differences were found between 4-mm buildups
      and endocrowns (p<0.05.) One endocrown and 2 restorations with a 2-mm buildup
      survived the load-to-failure test (at 4500 N). Only catastrophic fractures
      occurred after the load-to-failure test. CONCLUSIONS: The buildup design
      influenced the performance of endodontically treated molars restored with lithium
      disilicate CAD/CAM complete crowns placed with self-adhesive resin cement. The
      2-mm buildups were associated with higher loads to failure than the endocrown and
      the 4-mm buildup, but all restoration designs survived far beyond the normal
      range of masticatory forces.

      Crowns with Knife- Edge Finish Line: Up to 5-Year Retrospective Analysis of
      Clinical Performance.
LID - 10.1922/EJPRD_1930Scutella04 [doi]
AB  - This clinical study evaluated the survival of monolithic lithium disilicate (MLD)
      single crowns. Between January-2010 and January-2015, 87 patients received 122
      MLD (IPS e.max CAD) single crowns on natural teeth with knife-edge finish lines
      that were adhesively bonded (Maxcem Elite). MLD single crowns (N=122) were bonded
      on 60 molars (maxilla:35, mandible:25), 53 premolars (maxilla:27, mandible:26), 4
      canines (maxilla:2, mandible:2), 3 laterals and 2 centrals (maxilla). One crown
      fracture, one retention loss and one endodontic complication were experienced
      (survival rate: 97.5%). MLD single crowns could be safely indicated on teeth with
      knife-edge preparations.

TI  - Survival of extensively damaged endodontically treated incisors restored with
      different types of posts-and-core foundation restoration material.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Which post-and-core combination will best improve the
      performance of extensively damaged endodontically treated incisors without a
      ferrule is still unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to
      investigate the restoration of extensively damaged endodontically treated
      incisors without a ferrule using glass-ceramic crowns bonded to various composite
      resin foundation restorations and 2 types of posts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty
      decoronated endodontically treated bovine incisors without a ferrule were divided
      into 4 groups and restored with various post-and-core foundation restorations.
      NfPfB=no-ferrule (Nf) with glass-fiber post (Pf) and bulk-fill resin foundation
      restoration (B); NfPfP=no-ferrule (Nf) with glass-fiber post (Pf) and
      dual-polymerized composite resin core foundation restoration (P); NfPt=no-ferrule
      (Nf) with titanium post (Pt) and resin core foundation restoration; and
      NfPtB=no-ferrule (Nf) with titanium post (Pt) and bulk-fill resin core foundation
      restoration (B). Two additional groups from previously published data from the
      same authors (FPf=2mm of ferrule (F) and glass-fiber post (Pf) and composite
      resin core foundation restoration; and NfPf=no-ferrule (Nf) with glass-fiber post
      (Pf) and composite resin core foundation restoration), which were tested
      concomitantly and using the same experimental arrangement, were included for
      comparison. All teeth were prepared to receive bonded glass-ceramic crowns luted 
      with dual-polymerized resin cement and were subjected to accelerated fatigue
      testing under submerged conditions at room temperature. Cyclic isometric loading 
      was applied to the incisal edge at an angle of 30 degrees with a frequency of 5
      Hz, beginning with a load of 100 N (5000 cycles). A 100-N load increase was
      applied every 15000 cycles. The specimens were loaded until failure or to a
      maximum of 1000 N (140000 cycles). The 6 groups (4 groups from the present study 
      and 2 groups from the previously published study) were compared using the
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (log-rank post hoc test at alpha=.05 for pairwise 
      comparisons). RESULTS: None of the tested specimen withstood all 140 000 cycles. 
      All specimens without a ferrule were affected by an initial failure phenomenon
      (wide gap at the lingual margin between the core foundation restoration/crown
      assembly and the root). NfPfP, NfPt, and NfPtB had similar survival (29649 to
      30987 mean cycles until initial failure). NfPfB outperformed NfPt and NfPtB. None
      of the post-and-core foundation restoration materials were able to match the
      performance of the ferrule group FPf (72667 cycles). In all groups, 100% of
      failures were catastrophic. CONCLUSIONS: The survival of extensively damaged
      endodontically treated incisors without a ferrule was slightly improved by the
      use of a fiber post with a bulk-fill composite resin core foundation restoration.
      However, none of the post-and-core techniques was able to compensate for the
      absence of a ferrule. The presence of the posts always adversely affected the
      failure mode.

TI  - Marginal Fit Comparison of CAD/CAM Crowns Milled from Two Different Materials.
PG  - 421-428
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12683 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the marginal fit of CAD/CAM copings milled from hybrid
      ceramic (Vita Enamic) blocks and lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD) blocks, and
      to evaluate the effect of crystallization firing on the marginal fit of lithium
      disilicate copings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A standardized metal die with a
      1-mm-wide shoulder finish line was imaged using the CEREC AC Bluecam. The coping 
      was designed using CEREC 3 software. The design was used to fabricate 15 lithium 
      disilicate and 15 hybrid ceramic copings. Design and milling were accomplished by
      one operator. The copings were seated on the metal die using a pressure clamp
      with a uniform pressure of 5.5 lbs. A Macroview Microscope (14x) was used for
      direct viewing of the marginal gap. Four areas were imaged on each coping
      (buccal, distal, lingual, mesial). Image analysis software was used to measure
      the marginal gaps in mum at 15 randomly selected points on each of the four
      surfaces. A total of 60 measurements were made per specimen. For lithium
      disilicate copings the measurements for marginal gap were made before and after
      crystallization firing. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and Kruskal-Wallis
      test. RESULTS: The overall mean difference in marginal gap between the hybrid
      ceramic and crystallized lithium disilicate copings was statistically significant
      (p < 0.01). Greater mean marginal gaps were measured for crystallized lithium
      disilicate copings. The overall mean difference in marginal gap before and after 
      firing (precrystallized and crystallized lithium disilicate copings) showed an
      average of 62 mum increase in marginal gap after firing. This difference was also
      significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A significant difference exists in the
      marginal gap discrepancy when comparing hybrid ceramic and lithium disilicate
      CAD/CAM crowns. Also crystallization firing can result in a significant increase 
      in the marginal gap of lithium disilicate CAD/CAM crowns.

TI  - The effect of endodontic access on the failure load of lithium disilicate and
      resin nanoceramic CAD/CAM crowns.
PG  - 54-59
AB  - Currently, there is no consensus on whether crowns fabricated via computer-aided 
      design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) need to be replaced following an
      endodontic procedure. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect
      of endodontic access preparation and repair on the failure load of lithium
      disilicate and resin nanoceramic crowns. The hypothesis was that there would be
      no difference in the failure load between the intact and repaired crowns. Eighty 
      identical mandibular CAD/CAM crowns (40 lithium disilicate glass ceramic [IPS
      e.max CAD] and 40 resin nanoceramic [Lava Ultimate]) were milled and cemented on 
      80 identical polymethyl methacrylate resin dies. A standardized endodontic access
      preparation was made in half the specimens and restored with composite resin. All
      crowns were subjected to an occlusal load with a hydraulic testing machine until 
      failure. Based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test, the load to failure was
      significantly higher for the lithium disilicate crowns than for resin nanoceramic
      crowns in both the intact and repaired groups (P < 0.001). For the lithium
      disilicate crowns, the failure load was significantly higher for intact than for 
      repaired specimens (P = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference
      between intact and repaired specimens for resin nanoceramic. The repair of
      lithium disilicate and resin nanoceramic CAD/CAM crowns may provide a serviceable
      restoration under normal occlusal loads. However, replacement would be prudent in
      cases where parafunctional occlusal loading is suspected, the crown was not
      adhesively cemented, or there is an obvious defect in the existing crown.

      resistance and failure mode of layered translucent zirconia crowns, compared to
      the full monolithic zirconia crowns. Ninety crowns with different designs were
      divided into six groups (n=15); one fully contoured monolithic crown (FMC), one
      fully veneered with porcelain (FVC), or four partially veneered designs. All
      crowns were thermo-cycled, and then loaded to failure in a universal testing
      machine. The fracture resistance (N) and fracture modes were assessed. One-way
      ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey's multiple comparison (alpha<0.05). Results
      demonstrated that all the tested partially veneered designs exhibited enhanced
      fracture resistances and were comparable to that of the full-contour monolithic
      translucent zirconia crowns.

      cemented after distinct surface treatments: Fatigue performance and ceramic
      surface characteristics.

AB  - To evaluate the fatigue failure load (FFL), number of cycles for failure (CFF)
      and survival probabilities of lithium-disilicate (LD) monolithic crowns
      manufactured by two processing techniques (pressing vs. CAD/CAM) adhesively
      cemented to a dentin-analogue material, considering two surface treatments
      (conventional vs. simplified). Surface characteristics (topography, roughness and
      fractal dimensions) were also assessed. Forty (40) monolithic crowns were
      manufactured considering two specific processing techniques for each ceramic
      system: LD(CAD) - CAD/CAM lithium-disilicate (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent);
      LD(PRESS) - pressed lithium-disilicate (IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent). The
      crowns were adhesively cemented (Multilink Automix System, Ivoclar Vivadent) onto
      dentin analogue preparations considering two distinct protocols of surface
      treatments (conventional - hydrofluoric acid etching + silane application
      [HF+Sil] or simplified - etching with one-step primer (Monobond Etch&Prime,
      Ivoclar Vivadent) [EP]). The cemented assembly was stored in distilled water at
      37 degrees C for 3 days and fatigue tests were run (step-stress approach: load
      ranging from 400 to 2000N, step-size of 100N, 15,000 cycles/step, 20Hz).
      Fractography, surface topography, roughness, and fractal dimension analyses were 
      performed. LD(PRESS)[EP] group depicted higher FFL, CFF and survival
      probabilities in comparison to LD(CAD) groups, regardless of the conditioning
      method. A tendency of higher Weibull modulus (mechanical reliability) was
      observed when using [EP] for both LD(PRESS) and LD(CAD). SEM and AFM analysis
      showed very distinct initial surface patterns for the distinct processing
      techniques considered (LD(CAD) with higher fractal dimension and lower roughness 
      than LD(PRESS)), and both surface treatments distinctly affected these surface
      characteristics. All failures were radial cracks originating at the
      ceramic-cement interface. Pressed lithium-disilicate monolithic crowns showed
      better fatigue performance in comparison to CAD/CAM milled crowns, especially
      when they were treated with self-etching ceramic primer. The surface treatment
      with self-etching primer led to similar fatigue performance when compared to
      hydrofluoric acid plus silane application for the same processing technique, but 
      it tended to provide higher mechanical reliability.

TI  - Marginal and Internal Gap of Handmade, Milled and 3D Printed Additive
      Manufactured Patterns for Pressed Lithium Disilicate Onlay Restorations.
PG  - 31-38
LID - 10.1922/EJPRD_01733RevillaLeon08 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: On a pressed lithium disilicate restoration, the
      building up of a wax pattern of the future restoration is a necessary step on the
      fabrication process. Conventionally, a wax pattern can be produced by handmade or
      milled procedures; however, the development of additive manufacturing
      technologies allows a new fabrication method. PURPOSE: The present study measured
      the marginal and internal gap of handmade, milled and additive manufactured
      patterns for an onlay restoration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A preparation of an
      onlay restoration was made on an extracted mandibular tooth. A definitive cast
      was fabricated from a conventional silicone impression of the prepared tooth.
      Three groups were established: handmade (HM), milled (ML) and additive
      manufactured (AM); 4 specimens per group were obtained. The marginal and internal
      gap of each pattern was measured on the extracted molar through a computed
      tomography test. Sixty measurements were done to measure the marginal gap and
      another 60 measurements were calculated to analyze the internal gap on each
      pattern on the prepared tooth. A total of 1.440 measurements were completed.
      Mann-Whitney and Turkey statistical tests were used for pairwise comparison.
      RESULTS: The mean of the marginal and internal gap was of 67.56 +/- 6.08 mum and 
      80.62 +/- 3.26 mum for the HM group, 85.28 +/- 2.17 mum and 96 +/- 1.97 mum for
      the ML group and 86.49 +/- 1.74 mum and 91.86 +/- 2.88 mum for the AM group,
      respectively. The HM group presented significantly lower marginal (p=0.029) and
      internal (p=0.029) gap compared to the ML and AM groups. There was no statistical
      significant difference (p=0.486) on the marginal gap between the ML and the AM
      groups, but the AM group, showed significantly (p=0.029) smaller internal gap
      than the ML group. CONCLUSIONS: All the groups presented less than 100 mum
      marginal and internal gap, which is a considered clinically acceptable. CLINICAL 
      IMPLICATIONS: The three fabrication processes are viable option for manufacturing
      patterns for lithium disilicate onlay restorations, but the best marginal and
      internal fit was still obtained by the conventional handmade procedures.

TI  - Endocrowns Clinical Performance and Patient Satisfaction: A Randomized Clinical
      Trial of Three Monolithic Ceramic Restorations.
PG  - 30-37
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13414 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, clinical trial was to
      assess the survival of endocrowns made from three different monolithic ceramic
      materials, and to evaluate patient satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Fifty-three patients (sixty root canal treated molar teeth) were enrolled. Teeth 
      were prepared to a flat butt-joint margin and randomly divided between three
      material groups: lithium disilicate-reinforced glass-ceramic, monolithic zirconia
      and polymer infiltrated hybrid ceramic. Predefined cementation protocols were
      used. Clinical assessment using modified United States Public Health Service
      (USPHS) criteria was carried out after two years by two independent clinicians
      blinded to the material used. Radiographic examination was conducted to check for
      the presence of caries, excess cement, and periapical infection. Statistical
      analysis was performed using the Kruskal Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests as
      well as the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were
      available for assessment after 2 years (recall rate 90.6%). The overall
      Kaplan-Meier survival estimate among all groups was 90.9% with no statistically
      significant difference between the groups (p = 0.17). Three zirconia endocrowns
      debonded after 9, 10 and 13 months (82.4% survival rate), while 2 hybrid ceramic 
      endocrowns chipped/fractured (89.5% survival rate). Lithium disilicate endocrowns
      had a 100% survival rate. The Kruskal Wallis test revealed no statistically
      significant difference between the groups in the USPHS criteria ratings and the
      radiographic assessment (P>0.05). Patient satisfaction ranged from 82.3% in the
      zirconia group to 100% in both the lithium disilicate and hybrid ceramic groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Endocrowns provide a predictable option for the restoration of
      endodontically treated molar teeth in the short term. Lithium
      disilicate-reinforced ceramic had fewer complications and required less
      intervention compared with zirconia and hybrid ceramics. Long-term follow-up is
      required to substantiate these study results.

TI  - Fracture Resistance of Partial Indirect Restorations Made With CAD/CAM
      Technology. A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
LID - E1932 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm8111932 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine 
      the fracture resistance and survival rate of partial indirect restorations
      inlays, onlays, and overlays fabricated using computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology from ceramics, composite resin,
      resin nanoceramic, or hybrid ceramic and to analyze the influence of proximal box
      elevation on fracture resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review
      was based on guidelines proposed by the preferred reporting items for systematic 
      reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). An electronic search was conducted in
      databases US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health (PubMed),
      Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), and Embase. In vitro trials published during the
      last 10 years were included in the review. RESULTS: Applying inclusion criteria
      based on the review's population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO)
      question, 13 articles were selected. Meta-analysis by restoration type estimated 
      the fracture resistance of inlays to be 1923.45 Newtons (N); of onlays 1644 N and
      of overlays 1383.6 N. Meta-analysis by restoration material obtained an estimated
      fracture resistance for ceramic of 1529.5 N, for composite resin of 1600 Ne, for 
      resin nanoceramic 2478.7 N, and hybrid ceramic 2108 N. CONCLUSIONS: Resin
      nanoceramic inlays present significantly higher fracture resistance values.
      Proximal box elevation does not exert any influence on the fracture resistance of
      indirect restorations.

TI  - Marginal Fit Evaluation of CAD/CAM All Ceramic Crowns Obtained by Two Digital
      Workflows: An In Vitro Study Using Micro-CT Technology.
PG  - 1037-1043
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13115 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the marginal fit of CAD/CAM all ceramic crowns made from
      lithium disilicate and zirconia using two different fabrication protocols (model 
      and model-less). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty anterior all ceramic restorations
      (20 lithium disilicate, 20 zirconia) were fabricated from digital impressions
      using a CEREC Bluecam scanner. Two different digital workflows were used: a fully
      digital model-less approach and a printed model digital approach. The crowns were
      cemented on the respective prepared typodont teeth and marginal gap was evaluated
      using Micro-CT. Each specimen was analyzed in sagittal and trans-axial
      orientations, allowing evaluation of the marginal fit (vertical and horizontal)
      on each surface. Logarithmic transformation was used with a significance of 0.05.
      After that a reliability analysis was performed by re-measuring four randomized
      selected images for each specimen and performing intraclass correlations to
      determine any systematic bias in the measurements. RESULTS: Vertical measurements
      in the lingual, distal and mesial views had an estimated marginal gap ranging
      from 101.9 to 133.9 microm for lithium disilicate crowns and 126.4 to 165.4
      microm for zirconia. No significant differences were found between model and
      model-less techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Both workflows are valid protocols for the
      fabrication of monolithic ceramic restorations. The use of a printed model did
      not improve the marginal fit of lithium disilicate or zirconia crowns. Both
      materials are also clinically acceptable, no matter which workflow was used to
      obtain the restoration.

AB  - Implant therapy and CAD/CAM technologies are advancing quickly, providing
      predictable esthetic and functional treatment options. A recent development
      involves the use of zirconia-reinforced lithium-silicate ceramic for fabrication 
      of implant-supported restorations. Suitable for monolithic crowns, the material
      provides the optical advantages of a silicate ceramic with improved physical
      strength. Several prerequisites, however, are necessary to fabricate
      screw-retained monolithic restorations in the anterior maxilla. This case report 
      demonstrates the clinical steps to fabricate a monolithic ceramic CAD/CAM crown
      on an immediately placed dental implant in the esthetic zone.

AB  - STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: The complete polymerization of luting resins through
      thick indirect restorations is still questioned. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the degree of polymerization of light- and
      dual-polymerizable luting resins under thick indirect composite resin and ceramic
      endocrowns by means of Vickers microhardness measurements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      The Vickers microhardness measurements of a light-polymerizable microhybrid
      composite resin and a dual-polymerizable luting cement directly polymerized in a 
      natural tooth mold for 40 seconds with a high-power light-emitting diode lamp
      (control) were compared with measurements after indirect irradiation through
      7.5-mm-thick composite resin and ceramic endocrowns for 3 x 90 seconds. A
      test-to-control microhardness values ratio of 0.80 at a depth of 0.5 mm below the
      surface was assumed as the criterion for adequate conversion. RESULTS: For the
      Vickers microhardness measurements of a dual-polymerizable luting cement, no
      differences (P>.05) were found between Vickers microhardness control values and
      values reported after polymerization through composite resin and ceramic
      endocrowns. For The Vickers microhardness measurements (+/-SD) of a
      light-polymerizable microhybrid composite resin, control values were
      significantly (P<.05) higher (111 +/-3.3) than those reported after
      polymerization through composite resin (100.5 +/-3.8) and ceramic (99.7 +/-2.3)
      endocrowns. However, the hardness values of The Vickers microhardness
      measurements of a light-polymerizable microhybrid composite resin polymerized
      through the endocrowns were approximately 10% to 12% lower than those of the
      control values. Two-way ANOVA showed the influence of the luting material on the 
      Vickers microhardness values (P<.05). The effect of endocrown material was not
      significant (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this in vitro study,
      Vickers microhardness values of the dual-polymerizable resin cement and the
      light-polymerizable restorative composite resin irradiated for 3 x 90 seconds
      with a high irradiance light-emitting diode lamp through 7.5-mm-thick endocrowns 
      reached at least 80% of the control Vickers microhardness values, which means
      that both materials can be adequately polymerized when they are used for luting
      thick indirect restorations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the survival rate of ceramic and indirect composite
      inlays, onlays, and overlays manufactured according to different methods
      (CAD/CAM, pressable, and stratified). MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library
      databases were searched for published articles. Risk of bias, data extraction,
      subgroup analysis, meta-analysis, and GRADE was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Prospective, retrospective, or RCT studies, without restriction of language, from
      1983 to 2019, with follow-up >/=5 years, reporting survival rates were screened
      independently by two reviewers in accordance with eligibility criteria. RESULTS: 
      A total of 13 articles (12 for ceramic, one for indirect composite) met the
      inclusion criteria. No articles were included regarding crystalline ceramic. The 
      estimated cumulative survival rate for CAD/CAM was 97% after 5 years and 89%
      after 10 years; for pressable was 95% after 5 years, and for stratified was 88%
      after 5 years and 93% after 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the
      manufacturing method, vitreous ceramic inlays, onlays, and overlays showed high
      survival, providing evidence that these restorations are a safe treatment.
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Vitreous ceramic inlays, onlays, and overlays showed high
      survival, regardless of the manufacturing method, providing evidence that these
      restorations are a safe treatment.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the cavity preparation and
      ceramic type on the stress distribution, tooth strain, fracture resistance and
      fracture mode of human molar teeth restored with onlays. Material and Methods
      Forty-eight molars were divided into four groups (n=12) with assorted
      combinations of two study factors: BL- conventional onlay preparation with boxes 
      made from leucite ceramic (IPS-Empress CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent); NBL- conservative 
      onlay preparation without boxes made from leucite ceramic; BD- conventional onlay
      preparation with boxes made from lithium disilicate glass ceramic (IPS e.max CAD,
      Ivoclar Vivadent); NBL- conservative onlay preparation with boxes made from
      lithium disilicate glass ceramic cuspal deformation (microS) was measured at 100 
      N and at maximum fracture load using strain gauge. Fracture resistance (N) was
      measured using a compression test, and the fracture mode was recorded. Finite
      element analysis was used to evaluate the stress distribution by modified von
      Mises stress criteria. The tooth strain and fracture resistance data were
      analyzed using the Tukey test and two-way ANOVA, and the fracture mode was
      analyzed by the chi-square test (alpha=0.05). Results The leucite ceramic
      resulted in higher tooth deformation at 100 N and lower tooth deformation at the 
      maximum fracture load than the lithium disilicate ceramic (P<0.001). The lithium 
      disilicate ceramic exhibited higher fracture resistance than the leucite ceramic 
      (P<0.001). The conservative onlay resulted in higher fracture strength for
      lithium disilicate ceramic. Finite element analysis results showed the
      conventional cavity preparation resulted in higher stress concentration in the
      ceramic restoration and remaining tooth than the conservative onlay preparation. 
      The conservative onlays exhibited increased fracture resistance, reduced stress
      concentration and more favorable fracture modes. Conclusion Molars restored with 
      lithium disilicate CAD-CAM ceramic onlays exhibited higher fracture resistance
      than molars restored with leucite CAD-CAM ceramic onlays.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Differences between ceramic and metal-ceramic
      implant-supported fixed dental prostheses are unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of
      this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the technical,
      biological, and esthetic complication rates of implant-supported ceramic and
      metal-ceramic restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six databases were searched to 
      identify randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and prospective and
      retrospective cohort studies of implant-supported fixed dental prostheses. The
      survival rate, marginal adaptation, marginal bone loss, pocket probing depth,
      crown color match, and mucosal discoloration of ceramic and metal-ceramic single 
      crowns were assessed. For implant-supported fixed partial dental prostheses
      (FPDPs), only the survival rate was assessed. The risk of bias was assessed for
      individual studies and across studies by using the Cochrane guidelines,
      Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and funnel plots. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included
      in this meta-analysis. Ceramic and metal-ceramic implant-supported single crowns 
      were compared in terms of the survival rate (OR=0.84 [0.32, 2.23], P=.730),
      marginal adaptation (mean difference [MD]=0.33 [0.19, 0.47], P<.001), marginal
      bone loss (MD=-0.03 [-0.07, 0.02], P=.260), pocket probing depth (MD=-0.07
      [-0.14, 0.00], P=.060), crown color match (MD=-0.15 [-0.29, 0.00], P=.040), and
      mucosal discoloration (standardized mean difference [SMD]=-0.14 [-0.86, 0.58],
      P=.710). The survival rate of ceramic and metal-ceramic implant-supported FPDPs
      was also compared (odds ratio [OR]=1.92 [1.26, 2.94], P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: No
      significant difference was observed between ceramic and metal-ceramic
      implant-supported single crowns in terms of the survival rate, marginal bone
      loss, pocket probing depth, or mucosal discoloration. However, metal-ceramic
      single crowns had better marginal adaptation and poorer crown color match than
      did ceramic single crowns. In addition, current evidence indicates that
      metal-ceramic implant-supported FPDPs might have a higher survival rate than
      ceramic FPDPs.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Endocrowns are a monoblock type of restoration that use the
      pulp chamber and remaining coronal tooth structure as a means of retention.
      However, data on their long-term survival and success rates as compared with
      conventional crowns are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review
      and meta-analysis was to collate published work on endocrowns to assist
      clinicians in making decisions on when and whether they are an appropriate
      restorative option with a predictable outcome for extensively damaged
      endodontically treated teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Databases such as PubMed
      (MEDLINE), Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar were searched up 
      to June 2019 for clinical and in vitro studies on endocrown survival and success 
      rates. For the meta-analysis, endocrown and conventional crown survival and
      success rates were compared, and the pooled effects were presented as relative
      risks and 95% confidence intervals using a random effects model. RESULTS: Ten
      studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (3 clinical and 7 in vitro) and were
      included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis of the clinical studies
      showed an estimated overall 5-year survival rate of 91.4% for endocrowns and
      98.3% for conventional crowns. The estimated overall 5-year success rates were
      77.7% for endocrowns and 94% for conventional crowns. There were no significant
      differences in overall survival or success estimates between the assessed
      restorations (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed clinical studies with
      long-term assessment are needed; however, endocrowns appear to be a promising
      conservative restorative option with acceptable long-term survival for
      endodontically treated posterior teeth in selected patients.

TI  - The Effect of Resin Bonding on Long-Term Success of High-Strength Ceramics.
PG  - 132-139
LID - 10.1177/0022034517729134 [doi]
AB  - Digital manufacturing, all-ceramics, and adhesive dentistry are currently the
      trendiest topics in clinical restorative dentistry. Tooth- and implant-supported 
      fixed restorations from computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing 
      (CAM)-fabricated high-strength ceramics-namely, alumina and zirconia-are widely
      accepted as reliable alternatives to traditional metal-ceramic restorations. Most
      recent developments have focused on high-translucent monolithic full-contour
      zirconia restorations, which have become extremely popular in a short period of
      time, due to physical strength, CAD/CAM fabrication, and low cost. However,
      questions about proper resin bonding protocols have emerged, as they are critical
      for clinical success of brittle ceramics and treatment options that rely on
      adhesive bonds, specifically resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses or
      partial-coverage restorations such as inlays/onlays and veneers. Resin bonding
      has long been the gold standard for retention and reinforcement of low- to
      medium-strength silica-based ceramics but requires multiple pretreatment steps of
      the bonding surfaces, increasing complexity, and technique sensitivity compared
      to conventional cementation. Here, we critically review and discuss the evidence 
      on resin bonding related to long-term clinical outcomes of tooth- and
      implant-supported high-strength ceramic restorations. Based on a targeted
      literature search, clinical long-term studies indicate that porcelain-veneered
      alumina or zirconia full-coverage crowns and fixed dental prostheses have high
      long-term survival rates when inserted with conventional cements. However, most
      of the selected studies recommend resin bonding and suggest even greater success 
      with composite resins or self-adhesive resin cements, especially for
      implant-supported restorations. High-strength ceramic resin-bonded fixed dental
      prostheses have high long-term clinical success rates, especially when designed
      as a cantilever with only 1 retainer. Proper pretreatment of the bonding surfaces
      and application of primers or composite resins that contain special adhesive
      monomers are necessary. To date, there are no clinical long-term data on resin
      bonding of partial-coverage high-strength ceramic or monolithic zirconia
      restorations.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the influence
      of the wax fabrication technique on the internal adaptation and marginal accuracy
      of pressed ceramic single crowns. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was
      to compare the marginal and internal fi t of a lithium disilicate crown
      fabricated either from conventional waxing or from a subtractive milled wax
      pattern. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten silicone impressions were made for a maxillary
      canine prepared to receive a complete crown. Two pressed lithium disilicate glass
      ceramic copings were made on the die poured from each impression. The first was
      from a conventional wax pattern and the second from milled wax blocks. The
      replica technique was used to measure the fit by scanning electron microscope at 
      x80 magnification. Collected data were analyzed with the paired Student t test
      for the marginal and wall fit. For the occlusal fit, the difference in scores did
      not follow a normal distribution, and the Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used
      (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The mean values +SD were 170.3 +/-50.7 mum for the marginal
      fit and 130.3 +/-21.6 mum for the internal fit with the conventional technique.
      For the computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM)
      technique, they were 105.1 +/-39.6 mum and 98.1 +/-26.1 mum. Statistical
      significance was found for the marginal and internal fit (P<.05). The occlusal
      fit median and interval interquartile scores were 305.0 mum (269.9 to 334.4) for 
      conventional fabrication and 199.0 mum (141.5 to 269.9) for subtractive
      manufacturing. The differences were not statistically significant (P>.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: The subtractive CAD-CAM waxing technique resulted in the improved
      fit of a pressed lithium disilicate crown by decreasing the marginal
      discrepancies and internal adaptation.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Exposure to gastric acid in patients with bulimia nervosa
      and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) causes demineralization of hard tooth 
      structures. This chemical attack also causes the degradation of dental ceramics, 
      which results in increased surface roughness and reduced strength. However,
      studies comparing the effect of acidic pH on resin matrix ceramic with other
      computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) esthetic
      materials are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare
      the surface roughness changes of different CAD-CAM restorative dental materials
      after exposure to acidic pH by using a 3D optical interferometer. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Five esthetic CAD-CAM block materials, a leucite glass-ceramic (IPS
      Empress CAD), a zirconia (BruxZir Solid Zirconia), a resin matrix ceramic (VITA
      Enamic), a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), and a feldspathic
      porcelain (VITABLOCS Mark II CAD) were tested. Eighteen specimens were sectioned 
      from CAD-CAM blocks into 2-mm-thick rectangular plates and immersed in 10 mL of
      5% hydrochloric acid (HCl) with (pH=2) at 37 degrees C for 45 and 91 hours. The
      surface roughness average (Ra) of the specimens was measured by using a 3D
      optical interferometer before the storage period (baseline), after 45 hours, and 
      after 91 hours of exposure to HCl. Statistical analyses were performed with the
      Kruskal-Wallis test and the post hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni correction
      (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Regarding the comparison of surface roughness changes at
      different periods of evaluation (baseline, 45 hours, 91 hours), there were no
      statistically significant differences for lithium disilicate (P=.063) or zirconia
      (P=.513). Leucite glass-ceramic, feldspathic porcelain, and the resin matrix
      ceramic demonstrated statistically significant differences (P<.001). For all
      tests that were statistically significant, greater surface roughness was found at
      the time point with the longer HCl exposure. Regarding the comparison of
      materials in terms of change in surface roughness between baseline to 45 hours
      and baseline to 91 hours, the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a statistically
      significant difference among the materials in both cases (P<.001). Lithium
      disilicate and zirconia exhibited the least change in surface roughness among the
      5 materials. CONCLUSIONS: Leucite glass-ceramic, feldspathic porcelain, and resin
      matrix ceramic showed statistically significant increases in surface roughness
      when they were exposed to simulated gastric acid for 45 and 91 hours. Lithium
      disilicate and zirconia showed no statistically significant change in surface
      roughness after exposure to HCl for 45 and 91 hours.

AB  - A treatment protocol with lithium disilicate restorations and a computer-aided
      design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) fabrication process is proposed
      for the restoration of teeth in the esthetic zone. The technique involves trial
      insertion of restorations at the precrystallized stage, allowing verification of 
      the marginal fit and evaluation of the internal adaptation and overall esthetic
      plan to ensure an optimal clinical result for the definitive restorations.
      Furthermore, this procedure allows most adjustments to the lithium disilicate

      distribution in endodontically treated maxillary premolars: A finite element
      analysis.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: How tooth preparation and material type affect the stress
      distribution of endodontically treated teeth restored with endocrowns remains
      unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this finite element (FE) study was to determine 
      the influence of the quantity of remaining dental tissues and material type on
      stress distribution in endodontically treated maxillary premolars using
      3-dimensional FE analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five 3-dimensional FE models
      were constructed on the basis of the restorative methods used and the quantity of
      preserved tooth tissues: a sound maxillary premolar, an endodontically treated
      maxillary premolar restored with composite resin, and endodontically treated
      maxillary premolars restored with endocrowns with thicknesses of 1.0 mm, 2.0 mm, 
      and 3.0 mm. The following endocrown materials were used: Paradigm MZ100, IPS
      Empress, IPS e.max CAD, and In-Ceram Zirconia. Stress distributions were analyzed
      under vertical and oblique loads. RESULTS: As the quantity of preserved dental
      tissues increased, the von Mises stress in dentin decreased, and the peak von
      Mises strain value of the cement layer increased. When the elastic modulus of the
      endocrown material increased, the von Mises stress in endocrown and dentin
      increased, and the peak von Mises strain value of the cement layer decreased.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although the conservative preparation of teeth for endocrowns is
      likely to protect the residual tooth structure, it may cause future cohesive
      bonding failure. An increase in the elastic modulus of the material may benefit
      the durability of bonding between the endocrown and the abutment tooth; however, 
      it may cause fracture of the residual tooth structure.

TI  - [Influence of coping material selection and porcelain firing on marginal and
      internal fit of computer-aided design/computer- aided manufacturing of zirconia
      and titanium ceramic implant-supported crowns].
PG  - 262-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the influence of coping material and
      porcelain firing on the marginal and internal fit of computer-aided
      design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) of zirconia ceramic implant- and
      titanium ceramic implant-supported crowns. METHODS: Zirconia ceramic implant
      (group A, n = 8) and titanium metal ceramic implant-supported crowns (group B, n 
      = 8) were produced from copings using the CAD/CAM system. The marginal and
      internal gaps of the copings and crowns were measured by using a light-body
      silicone replica technique combined with micro-computed tomography scanning to
      obtain a three-dimensional image. Marginal gap (MG), horizontal marginal
      discrepancy (HMD), and axial wall (AW) were measured. Statistical analyses were
      performed using SPSS 17.0. RESULTS: Prior to porcelain firing, the measurements
      for MG, HMD, and AW of copings in group A were significantly larger than those in
      group B (P < 0.05). After porcelain firing, the measurements for MG of crowns in 
      group A were smaller than those in group B (P < 0.05), whereas HMD and AW showed 
      no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Porcelain firing
      significantly reduced MG (P < 0.05) in group A but significantly increased MG,
      HMD, and AW in group B (P < 0.05) HMD and AW were not influenced by porcelain
      firing in group A (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The marginal fits of CAD/CAM zirconia
      ceramic implant-supported crowns were superior to those of CAD/CAM titanium
      ceramic-supported crowns. The fits of both the CAD/CAM zirconia ceramic implant- 
      and titanium ceramic implant-supported crowns were obviously influenced by
      porcelain firing.

TI  - CAD/CAM technology and esthetic dentistry: a case report.
PG  - 764, 766, 768 passim
AB  - Advances in dental materials as well as in computer technology have made
      CADCAM-fabricated restorations not just possible in dentistry but plentiful. When
      using CADCAM systems, operators can fabricate restorations from several
      materials, including ceramics, metal alloys, and various composites. This case
      report describes the replacement of a porcelain-layered zirconia-based (coping)
      crown on a left lower cuspid that presented with a veneering ceramic chipping on 
      a lithium-disilicate CADCAM-fabricated crown. It demonstrates how all-ceramic
      systems offer a promising alternative in the restoration of anterior teeth.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: No consensus exists concerning the acceptable ranges of
      marginal fit for lithium disilicate crowns fabricated with either heat-pressing
      techniques or computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)
      systems. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate with micro-computed
      tomography the marginal fit of lithium disilicate crowns fabricated with
      different chairside CAD/CAM systems (Cerec or E4D) or the heat-pressing
      technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated to fit
      an in vitro cast of a single human premolar. Three fabrication techniques were
      used: digital impressions with Cerec 3D Bluecam scanner with titanium dioxide
      powder, followed by milling from IPS e.max CAD for Cerec; digital impressions
      with E4D Laser scanner without powder, followed by milling from IPS e.max CAD for
      E4D; and fabrication from IPS e.max Press by using the lost-wax and heat-pressing
      techniques. Each crown was fixed to the cast and scanned with micro-computed
      tomography to obtain 52 images for measuring the vertical and horizontal fit.
      Data were statistically analyzed by 1-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey honestly
      significant difference test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The mean values of vertical
      misfit were 36.8 +/-13.9 mum for the heat-pressing group and 39.2 +/-8.7 mum for 
      the Cerec group, which were significantly smaller values than for the E4D group
      at 66.9 +/-31.9 mum (P=.046). The percentage of crowns with a vertical misfit <75
      mum was 83.8% for Cerec and heat-pressing, whereas this value was 65% for E4D.
      Both types of horizontal misfit (underextended and overextended) were 49.2% for
      heat-pressing, 50.8% for Cerec, and 58.8% for E4D. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium
      disilicate crowns fabricated by using the Cerec 3D Bluecam scanner CAD/CAM system
      or the heat-pressing technique exhibited a significantly smaller vertical misfit 
      than crowns fabricated by using an E4D Laser scanner CAD/CAM system.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the marginal fit of press-fabricated
      lithium disilicate crowns with that of computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing (CAD/CAM) lithium disilicate crowns to determine if the fabrication
      method has an influence on marginal fit. The marginal fit of 25 pressed and 25
      CAD/CAM crowns was measured using the replica technique. The sites measured were 
      the mesial, distal, facial, and lingual margins. A microscope at 10x
      magnification was used to obtain the measurements. Each site was measured 4
      times, and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to assess measurement
      errors. An unpaired t test was used to evaluate the differences between the 2
      groups. Mean marginal gap measurements were greater for CAD/CAM crowns than for
      pressed crowns at all sites. Only the difference in mean gap at the facial margin
      was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Press-fabricated lithium disilicate
      crowns provided a better marginal fit than those fabricated by CAD/CAM, but both 
      fabrication methods provided crowns with a clinically acceptable marginal fit.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Various computer-aided design and computer-aided
      manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials are available to fabricate complete crowns. The
      type of material may have an effect on the longevity of these restorations.
      PURPOSE: To evaluate the fatigue resistance, load-to-failure, failure mode, and
      antagonistic wear of complete molar computer-aided design and computer-aided
      manufacturing (CAD/CAM) crowns made of resin nanoceramic (RNC), feldspathic glass
      ceramic (FEL), or lithium disilicate (LD) placed with a simplified cementation
      process. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five molars received a standardized complete
      crown preparation and were restored with CAD/CAM crowns (1.5-mm thickness, n=15) 
      made of RNC, FEL, and LD. After cementation, the restorations were submitted to
      cyclic isometric loading: 200 (x5000), 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 N at a
      maximum of 30 000 cycles each. Surviving specimens were axially loaded until
      failure or to a maximum load of 4500 N. The specimens were analyzed as to failure
      mode: catastrophic, possibly repairable, and repairable. The groups were compared
      by using the life table survival analysis and the t test (alpha=.05). RESULTS:
      All the specimens survived the fatigue process until the 800-N step. The survival
      rate of RNC was 80%, LD 93.3%, and FEL 6.6%. The survival of RNC and LD crowns
      did not differ from each other but exceeded that of FEL. Postfatigue
      load-to-failure test was 2500 N (FEL), 3122 N (RNC), and 3237 N (LD). No
      catastrophic failure occurred in the fatigue test, whereas all of the specimens
      in the load-to-failure test exhibited catastrophic fractures. Crowns made of RNC 
      seemed to generate the least amount of antagonistic wear. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior 
      crowns made of RNC and LD were not statistically different, and both had
      significantly higher fatigue resistance than FEL. All materials survived beyond
      the normal range of masticatory forces, and all failures were possibly
      re-restorable except those in the load-to-failure test. RNC crowns seemed to
      cause less wear of the antagonist.

TI  - CAD/CAM and lithium disilicate: an anterior esthetic case study.
PG  - 141-4
AB  - Digital technology has brought a new and exciting dimension to dental esthetics. 
      Innovative ways to take impressions and create chair-side restorations are
      continuing to expand and new dental materials specifically made for CAD/CAM are
      allowing for extremely esthetic restorations. Lithium disilicate is one such
      material that is efficiently milled, has a favorable flexural strength, and
      provides highly esthetic chair-side restorations. The following is a case study
      that utilizes lithium disilicate for esthetic full coverage crowns on teeth #7,
      8, 9, and 10.

TI  - Comparative reliability analyses of zirconium oxide and lithium disilicate
      restorations in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 4S-9S
AB  - BACKGROUND: The authors analyzed the in vitro and in vivo performance of lithium 
      disilicate glass-ceramic (LDGC) restorations and yttria-stabilized tetragonal
      zirconia polycrystalline (Y-TZP) (that is, zirconium oxide) restorations with
      regard to reliability, clinical performance and abrasion resistance. METHODS: In 
      the in vitro study, four authors subjected samples of LDGC, Y-TZP and
      metal-ceramic crowns to step-stress fatigue testing. Four investigators assessed 
      the in vivo clinical performance of LDGC and zirconium oxide-based restorations
      at four and seven years, respectively. In addition, one author conducted a
      randomized, controlled clinical trial to analyze the volumetric loss of enamel
      and ceramic antagonist surfaces. RESULTS: The LDGC crowns exhibited the highest
      fatigue load-to-failure values in the in vitro analysis. The results of the in
      vivo assessment showed that the clinical performance of the LDGC restorations at 
      four years was comparable to that of the zirconium oxide-based crowns at seven
      years. The results of the in vivo, randomized, controlled clinical trial showed
      that LDGC crowns were not only resistant to wear, but also were wear friendly to 
      enamel antagonist surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The LDGC crowns in the in vitro and in
      vivo studies exhibited high durability, and they were wear friendly to opposing
      natural dentition. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: LDGC and zirconium oxide-based crowns
      are a clinically acceptable means of treating teeth that require full-coverage
      restorations. In addition, LDGC materials exhibit excellent clinical performance,
      as well as demonstrate acceptable abrasion compatibility with the opposing
      natural dentition.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Lithium disilicate is a relatively new and popular
      restorative material for esthetic and functional rehabilitations, but the
      evidence for clinical outcomes is not clear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      systematic review was to analyze the short-term (1- to 5-year) and medium-term
      (5- to 10-year) survival rates of lithium disilicate single crowns and partial
      fixed dental prostheses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search for articles 
      in the English-language literature published between January 1998 and June 2013
      was performed with the PubMed search engine. The specific search terms used were 
      lithium disilicate, lithium silicate, IPS e max, IPS Empress, CAD CAM, pressed
      ceramic, monolithic, and bilayer. After applying predetermined inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, the definitive list of selected articles was suitable only
      for calculating the interval survival rate and cumulative survival rate. RESULTS:
      The electronic search resulted in 2033 titles. The systematic application of
      inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in 12 clinical studies that addressed
      the clinical outcomes of lithium disilicate restorations. Of these, 2 were
      randomized controlled trials, 5 were prospective studies, 1 was a retrospective
      study, and 4 studies were descriptive in nature. All 12 studies reported on
      tooth-retained lithium disilicate restorations. The 2-year cumulative survival
      rate for single crowns was 100%, and the 5-year cumulative survival rate was
      97.8%. The 2-year cumulative survival rate for fixed dental prostheses was 83.3%,
      and the 5-year cumulative survival rate was 78.1%. The cumulative survival rate
      over a 10-year period, primarily owing to data from 1 study, was 96.7% for single
      crowns and 70.9% for fixed dental prostheses. CONCLUSIONS: For lithium disilicate
      single crowns, the existing evidence indicates excellent short-term survival
      rates, but the evidence for medium-term survival is limited. For lithium
      disilicate fixed dental prostheses, the evidence for short-term survival is fair,
      although limited, but the evidence for medium-term survival is not promising. The
      majority of failures in both types of restorations were reported in the posterior
      region.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the vertical marginal gap of teeth restored with
      lithium disilicate crowns fabricated using CAD/CAM or by pressed ceramic
      approach. Twenty mandibular third molar teeth were collected after surgical
      extractions and prepared to receive full veneer crowns. Teeth were optically
      scanned and lithium disilicate blocks were used to fabricate crowns using CAD/CAM
      technique. Polyvinyl siloxane impressions of the prepared teeth were made and
      monolithic pressed lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated. The marginal gap
      was measured using optical microscope at 200x magnification (Keyence VHX-5000,
      Japan). Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon test. The lithium
      disilicate pressed crowns had significantly smaller (p = 0.006) marginal gaps (38
      +/- 12 mum) than the lithium disilicate CAD/CAM crowns (45 +/- 12 mum). This
      research indicates that lithium disilicate crowns fabricated with the press
      technique have measurably smaller marginal gaps compared with those fabricated
      with CAD/CAM technique within in vitro environments. The marginal gaps achieved
      by the crowns across all groups were within a clinically acceptable range.

TI  - The Influence of Different Designs, Materials and Cements on the Success and
      Survival Rate of Endocrowns. A Systematic Review.
PG  - 100-111
LID - 10.1922/EJPRD_1992Papia12 [doi]
AB  - The aim is to evaluate the success and survival rate of endocrowns and the
      influence of design, material and cements. A search of clinical trials of
      endocrowns was performed using three databases (Medline/PubMed, Scopus,
      CochraneLibrary), complemented by a manual search. The search resulted in 2,718
      studies, six of which were included for analysis. The follow-up times were 2-12
      years. Feldspathic porcelain was the material of choice cemented with different
      adhesive resin cement systems. Designs varied significantly. In total, the six
      studies represented 471 endocrowns. Thirty-six of these failed. Most common
      failures were loss of retention and fracture. Due to insufficient information on 
      timing of events and drop-out, no statistical analysis was performed. No
      conclusive correlation between design, material, cement and success or survival
      of endocrowns could be established. Signs of differences in survival rates
      between molar and premolar endocrowns were noted, with a tendency towards higher 
      survival rates for molar endocrowns. Feldspathic ceramic endocrowns with adhesive
      cementation demonstrate promising clinical performance. These conclusions are
      however based on a limited number of studies of comparatively low quality.
      Further studies are thus needed to verify the conclusions and to provide guidance
      in the clinical decision on best choice of materials, design and cements.

TI  - A Thorough Analysis of the Endocrown Restoration: A Literature Review.
PG  - 422-426
AB  - AIM: The aim of this literature review is to determine whether endocrowns are a
      reliable alternative for endodontically treated teeth with extensive loss of
      tooth structure, the indications and contraindications of this restorative
      choice, the principles that should be followed for tooth preparation and which
      material is most appropriate for endocrown fabrication. BACKGROUND:
      Rehabilitation of endodontically treated teeth with severe coronal destruction
      has always been a challenge for the dental clinician. Until recently, the
      fabrication of a metal-ceramic or all-ceramic full-coverage crown along with a
      metal or glass fiber post has been the ""gold standard"" proving its efficacy via
      numerous clinical studies. With the development of CAD/CAM technology and the
      evolution of dental materials, new minimally invasive techniques have been
      introduced with less need for adjustments and less incorporation of structural
      defects. One of them, the ""monoblock technique,"" proposed by Pissis in 1995, was 
      the forerunner of endocrown restoration, a term used by Bindl and Mormann to
      describe an all-ceramic crown anchored to the internal portion of the pulp
      chamber and on the cavity margins, thus obtaining macromechanical retention
      provided by the axial opposing pulpal walls and microretention attained with the 
      use of adhesive cementation. REVIEW RESULTS: Endocrowns require a decay-oriented 
      preparation taking advantage of both the adhesion and the retention from the
      pulp-chamber walls, they are strongly indicated in endodontically treated molars 
      in cases where minimal interocclusal space and curved or narrow root canals are
      present and they should be manufactured from materials that can be bonded to the 
      tooth structure. CONCLUSION: Endocrowns are a reliable alternative to traditional
      restorative choices, given that the clinicians respect the requirements and
      indications describing this technique. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Traditional
      restorative techniques demanding tooth substance removal and minimizing the
      opportunity for reinterventions should be reconsidered.

TI  - Prospective 5-year clinical evaluation of posterior zirconia fixed dental
      prostheses veneered with milled lithium disilicate (CADon).
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12877 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bi-layer zirconia-based posterior fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) have 
      reportedly a high incidence of veneering ceramic fractures. The CADon technique
      employs zirconia frameworks veneered with milled lithium disilicate glass-ceramic
      to overcome these shortcomings but long-term clinical studies are missing. This
      study evaluated the clinical efficacy of posterior 3-unit CADOn FDPs over a
      5-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients, 16 male and 9
      female with a mean age of 55.6 years, received a total of 25 posterior three-unit
      CADOn FDPs. Patients were recalled for baseline and for follow-up visits at 6,
      12, 24, and 60 months. Parameters evaluated were fracture, marginal adaptation,
      marginal discoloration, wear, polish, color match, surface staining, and
      retention of these restorations as well as secondary caries of the abutment
      teeth. RESULTS: A total of 21 FDPs evaluated at 60-months revealed a 100%
      survival rate. All evaluated clinical parameters were satisfactory (alpha or
      bravo) and there was no statistically significant difference at different time
      points, except for surface staining, which was also worse at 60 months compared
      to baseline (p </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CADOn three-unit posterior FDPs
      demonstrate excellent fracture resistance after 5 years of clinical function. All
      evaluated clinical parameters were satisfactory, except for surface stain, which 
      also increased over time. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Conventionally veneered bi-layer
      zirconia-based posterior FDPs have limited clinical success. Based on this study,
      alternative methods such as zirconia frameworks veneered with milled lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic provide a viable alternative with excellent long-term
      clinical outcomes.

TI  - Clinical Performance of CAD/CAM Monolithic Lithium Disilicate Implant-Supported
      Single Crowns Using Solid or Predrilled Blocks in a Fully Digital Workflow: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study With Up To 33 Months of Follow Up.
PG  - 38-44
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13364 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the clinical performance of CAD/CAM monolithic
      implant-supported restorations manufactured using a fully digital workflow and
      two different types of ceramic blocks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and one
      patients received single-unit implant-supported restorations at a University
      predoctoral clinic. All restorations were designed and fabricated using either a 
      predrilled LS2 block (group P, n = 59) or a conventional solid LS2 block with an 
      occlusal opening drilled manually prior to crystallization (group M, n = 42). The
      mean follow-up time after restoration delivery was 18.4 +/- 4.8 months (range 12 
      to 33 months). Patients with less than a 12-month follow-up were excluded.
      Electronic health records were reviewed to identify number and type of
      complications during the follow-up time. Clinical outcomes were classified as
      success, survival, and failure of the restoration. Chi-square tests were used to 
      identify differences in success and survival rates between the groups.
      Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests were used to identify differences in the
      number of major and minor complications as well as the total number of
      complications that were observed among groups. RESULTS: Overall success and
      survival rates were 80.2% and 97%, respectively. Seventy one restorations (70.3%)
      were complication-free. There were no significant differences between the groups 
      with regards to the number of complications or success and survival rates.
      CONCLUSIONS: Single-unit CAD/CAM monolithic implant-supported restorations that
      are fabricated in a fully digital workflow present relatively high complication
      rates and moderate short-term clinical outcomes. Clinical studies with longer
      follow-up times are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes of these restorations.

AB  - Advances in dental ceramic materials and the development of computer-aided
      design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and milling technology have
      facilitated the development and application of superior dental ceramics. CAD/CAM 
      allows the use of materials that cannot be used with conventional dental
      processing techniques. This article reviews the main techniques and new materials
      used in dentistry for CAD/CAM-generated crowns and fixed partial dentures. Also

TI  - Biomechanical Assessment of Restored Mandibular Molar by Endocrown in Comparison 
      to a Glass Fiber Post-Retained Conventional Crown: 3D Finite Element Analysis.
PG  - 988-996
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12690 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare equivalent and contact stresses in a mandibular molar
      restored by all-ceramic crowns through two methods: ceramic endocrowns and
      ceramic crowns supported by fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) posts and core, by
      using 3D finite element analysis during normal masticatory load. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Three 3D models of a mandibular first molar were made and labeled as
      such: intact molar with no restoration (A); ceramic endocrown-restored molar (B);
      ceramic crown supported by FRC posts and core restored molar (C). By using 3D FE 
      analysis with contact components, normal masticatory load was simulated. The mvM 
      stresses in all models were calculated. Maximal mvM stresses in the ceramic of
      restorations, dentin, and luting cement were contrasted among models and to
      values of materials' strength. Contact shear and tensile stresses in the
      restoration/tooth interface around restorations were also calculated. RESULTS:
      The highest mvM stress levels in the enamel and dentin for the tooth restored by 
      ceramic endocrown were lower in the crown ceramic than in tooth restored with FRC
      posts and all-ceramic crowns; however, in the resin adhesive cement interface it 
      was lower for ceramic crown supported by FRC posts than the in ceramic endocrown 
      restoration. The maximum contact shear and tensile stress values along the
      restoration/tooth interface of ceramic endocrowns were lower than those with
      ceramic crowns supported by FRC posts. CONCLUSIONS: Ceramic endocrown
      restorations presented a lower mvM stress level in dentin than the conventional
      ceramic crowns supported by FRC posts and core. Ceramic endocrown restorations in
      molars are less susceptible to damage than those with conventional ceramic crowns
      retained by FRC posts. Ceramic endocrowns properly cemented in molars must not be
      fractured or loosen during normal masticatory load. Therefore, ceramic endocrowns
      are advised as practicable, minimally invasive, and esthetic restorations for
      root canal treated mandibular molars.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Long-term clinical data on the survival of pressed lithium 
      disilicate glass-ceramic restorations and the effect that different technical and
      clinical variables have on survival are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      clinical study was to examine the 10-year survival of pressed lithium disilicate 
      glass-ceramic restorations and the relationship between clinical parameters on
      outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five hundred and fifty-six patients, ranging in
      age from 17 to 97 years, from a private clinical practice were enrolled. All
      participants required single-tooth replacement or repair in any area of the
      mouth, including single crowns, 3-unit fixed partial dentures, cantilevered
      anterior restorations, and foundation restorations. Together, the longevity of
      1960 complete-coverage restorations was studied. Participants were offered the
      options of gold, conventional metal-ceramic, or lithium disilicate restoration.
      Participants who chose glass-ceramic restorations were included in the study. The
      overall survival of the glass-ceramic restorations was assessed by using clinical
      factors determined at recall, and the effect of various clinical parameters was
      evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier survival curves to account for attrition bias and
      other reasons for failure. The statistical significance of differences between
      parameters was determined using the log-rank test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: A total
      of 556 patients electing lithium disilicate restorations were evaluated. The mean
      age of patients at the time of restoration placement was 62 years, with a range
      of 17 to 97 years. Men comprised 39.5% of the patients, and women, 60.5%. Many
      patients required more than one restoration. Seven failures (bulk fracture or
      large chip requiring replacement) were recorded for the 1960 complete-coverage
      lithium disilicate restorations, with the average time of failure being 4.2
      years. The total time at risk computed for the units was 5113 years, providing an
      estimated failure risk of 0.14% per year. The 10-year estimated cumulative
      survival was 99.6% (95% confidence : 99.4-99.8).The estimated cumulative survival
      rate of 1410 monolithic and 550 bilayered e.max complete-coverage restorations
      was 96.5% and 100%, respectively, at 10.4 and 7.9 years (P<.05). Seven failures
      were recorded for the monolithic complete-coverage restoration units placed. The 
      total time at risk for these monolithic units was 3380 years, providing an
      estimated risk of 0.2% per year. Failures were primarily in molar teeth (5 of 7) 
      and occurred in both arches (3/2). No failures were recorded for the bilayered
      complete-coverage restorations. The total time at risk computed for the bilayered
      units was 1733 years, providing an estimated risk of 0% per year. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pressed lithium disilicate restorations in this study survived successfully over 
      the 10.4-year period studied with an overall failure rate below 0.2% per year and
      were primarily confined to molar teeth. The risk of failure at any age was
      minimal for both men and women.

TI  - Fracture Resistance of Pressed and Milled Lithium Disilicate Anterior Complete
      Coverage Restorations Following Endodontic Access Preparation.
PG  - 163-170
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12798 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study evaluated the fracture resistance and clinical
      prognosis of anterior lithium disilicate crowns (e.max Press and e.max CAD),
      following endodontic access and repair. The research design simulates intraoral
      loading conditions to produce clinically applicable results. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Monolithic anterior crowns, based on #8 anatomy, were fabricated from
      e.max Press ingots and e.max CAD blocks and adhesively bonded on identical dies
      milled out of a dentin analog material (NEMA G10). Specimens were divided into 4 
      groups: intact pressed, repaired pressed, intact milled, and repaired milled (n =
      15/group). Repaired pressed and repaired milled were prepared with a standardized
      endodontic access and repaired using a porcelain repair system and composite
      resin. All crowns were cyclically loaded under simulated oral conditions and then
      loaded to failure in water, using a universal testing machine. Data were
      interpreted using ANOVA/Tukey post-hoc test (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: Mean loads
      to failure ranged from 758.9 to 931.4 N for the 4 groups, indicating that both
      fabrication techniques, pressed and milled, yielded restorations that could
      reasonably withstand maximum masticatory forces. The pressed groups (923.7 N)
      exhibited significantly higher fracture resistance than the milled groups (797.5 
      N), p = 0.0002. When milled and pressed groups were categorized into intact and
      repaired subgroups, no difference was found in fracture resistance between the
      subgroups. Differences were noted in the modes of fracture, where the milled
      groups (intact and repaired) exhibited higher frequency of catastrophic fractures
      than the pressed groups. CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic access preparation does not
      appear to affect fracture resistance of an anterior lithium disilicate
      restoration, suggesting that replacement may not be necessary. Fabrication
      technique had a significant effect on fracture resistance and fracture mode of
      lithium disilicate restorations. The pressed fabrication technique resulted in
      significantly greater crown strength and fracture resistance than the milled
      technique.

TI  - Fracture resistance of computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing-generated composite resin-based molar crowns.
PG  - 122-9
LID - 10.1111/eos.12173 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether different fabrication processes,
      such as the computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system
      or the manual build-up technique, affect the fracture resistance of composite
      resin-based crowns. Lava Ultimate (LU), Estenia C&B (EC&B), and lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic IPS e.max press (EMP) were used. Four types of molar
      crowns were fabricated: CAD/CAM-generated composite resin-based crowns (LU
      crowns); manually built-up monolayer composite resin-based crowns (EC&B-monolayer
      crowns); manually built-up layered composite resin-based crowns (EC&B-layered
      crowns); and EMP crowns. Each type of crown was cemented to dies and the fracture
      resistance was tested. EC&B-layered crowns showed significantly lower fracture
      resistance compared with LU and EMP crowns, although there was no significant
      difference in flexural strength or fracture toughness between LU and EC&B
      materials. Micro-computed tomography and fractographic analysis showed that
      decreased strength probably resulted from internal voids in the EC&B-layered
      crowns introduced by the layering process. There was no significant difference in
      fracture resistance among LU, EC&B-monolayer, and EMP crowns. Both types of
      composite resin-based crowns showed fracture loads of >2000 N, which is higher
      than the molar bite force. Therefore, CAD/CAM-generated crowns, without internal 
      defects, may be applied to molar regions with sufficient fracture resistance.

TI  - Translucency of zirconia copings made with different CAD/CAM systems.
PG  - 6-12
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(10)60086-8 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Zirconia cores are reported to be less translucent than
      glass, lithium disilicate, or alumina cores. This could affect the esthetic
      appearance and the clinical choices made when using zirconia-based restorations. 
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the translucency of
      zirconia copings for single crowns fabricated using different CAD/CAM systems,
      using lithium disilicate glass ceramic as a control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using 
      impressions made from a stainless steel complete-crown master die, 9 stone cast
      replicas were fabricated, numbered, and distributed into 8 ceramic ZrO(2) CAD/CAM
      system groups (Lava Frame 0.3 and 0.5, IPS e.max ZirCAD, VITA YZ, Procera
      AllZircon, Digizon, DC Zircon, and Cercon Base) and to a lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic control group (IPS e.max Press) using a simple computer-generated
      randomization method. From each die, the manufacturer's authorized milling
      centers supplied 5 copings per group without applying any dying technique to the 
      ceramic base material. The copings were prepared to allow for a 40-mum cement
      layer and were of different thicknesses according to system specifications.
      Translucency was measured by the direct transmission method with a digital
      photoradiometer mounted in a dark chamber. The light source was a 150-W halogen
      lamp beam. Measurements were repeated 3 times for each specimen. Data obtained
      were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni multiple comparison test
      (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Among ZrO(2) copings, Lava (0.3 mm and 0.5 mm thick) showed
      the highest (P<.05) values of translucency measured as light flow units (3.572 + 
      or - 018 x 10(3) lx and 3.181 + or - 0.13 x 10(3) lx, respectively). These values
      represent 71.7% and 63.9%, respectively, of the glass-ceramic control group (4.98
      x 10(3) lx). CONCLUSIONS: All ZrO(2) copings demonstrated different levels of
      light transmission, with the 2 Lava specimens showing the highest values.
      Translucency of zirconia copings was significantly lower (P=.001) than that of
      the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic control.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The comparative assessment of computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology and other fabrication
      techniques pertaining to marginal adaptation should be documented. Limited
      evidence exists on the effect of restorative material on the performance of a
      CAD-CAM system relative to marginal adaptation. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      systematic review was to investigate whether the marginal adaptation of CAD-CAM
      single crowns, fixed dental prostheses, and implant-retained fixed dental
      prostheses or their infrastructures differs from that obtained by other
      fabrication techniques using a similar restorative material and whether it
      depends on the type of restorative material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic 
      search of English-language literature published between January 1, 2000, and June
      30, 2016, was conducted of the Medline/PubMed database. RESULTS: Of the 55
      included comparative studies, 28 compared CAD-CAM technology with conventional
      fabrication techniques, 12 contrasted CAD-CAM technology and copy milling, 4
      compared CAD-CAM milling with direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), and 22
      investigated the performance of a CAD-CAM system regarding marginal adaptation in
      restorations/infrastructures produced with different restorative materials.
      CONCLUSIONS: Most of the CAD-CAM restorations/infrastructures were within the
      clinically acceptable marginal discrepancy (MD) range. The performance of a
      CAD-CAM system relative to marginal adaptation is influenced by the restorative
      material. Compared with CAD-CAM, most of the heat-pressed lithium disilicate
      crowns displayed equal or smaller MD values. Slip-casting crowns exhibited
      similar or better marginal accuracy than those fabricated with CAD-CAM.
      Cobalt-chromium and titanium implant infrastructures produced using a CAD-CAM
      system elicited smaller MD values than zirconia. The majority of cobalt-chromium 
      restorations/infrastructures produced by DMLS displayed better marginal accuracy 
      than those fabricated with the casting technique. Compared with copy milling, the
      majority of zirconia restorations/infrastructures produced by CAD-CAM milling
      exhibited better marginal adaptation. No clear conclusions can be drawn about the
      superiority of CAD-CAM milling over the casting technique and DMLS regarding
      marginal adaptation.

TI  - Effects of substrate, ceramic thickness, translucency, and cement shade on the
      color of CAD/CAM lithium-disilicate crowns.
PG  - 457-464
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12470 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of
      substrate colors, different levels of ceramic thickness and translucency, and
      cement shades on the color difference from a reference color of
      lithium-disilicate crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A premolar tooth preparation
      was made on a study model for 1.0 and 1.5 mm thick full-ceramic crowns. Digital
      impressions were taken (3Shape TRIOS) and crowns designed in a CAD program
      (DentalDesigner). Shade A1 crowns were milled (Everest, Kavo) from
      high-translucency (HT) and low-translucency IPS e.max (Ivoclar Vivadent) blocks. 
      Twelve substrates were made of different colors and materials (Natural Die
      Material, Co-Cr, zirconia, and gold-colored alloy). Three different shades of
      try-in pastes were used to simulate the effect of cements (Variolink Esthetic
      try-in paste; Ivoclar). Shade measurement was done three times for each crown by 
      a spectrophotometer (VITA Easyshade Advance); averages were compared to a
      reference crown (A1, HT, 1.5 mm, ND2 abutment, neutral try-in paste) with
      DeltaE00 (CIEDE2000, according to the CIE latest standard) calculated. RESULTS:
      All the examined parameters influenced the DeltaE00 of the crowns. The weakest
      effect was exerted by the try-in paste. CONCLUSIONS: All examined parameters
      influenced the final color of e.max CAD lithium-disilicate ceramic crowns.
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Matching the shade of ceramic crowns to the natural tooth 
      color is a great challenge in dentistry. To meet patients' increasing esthetical 
      expectations, CAD/CAM methods are very popular for full-ceramic crowns. However, 
      several factors such as the shade of the abutment, luting cement color, ceramic
      thickness, and translucency may influence the final color. Our objective was to
      measure the optical effect of these factors on the final shade of CAD/CAM
      lithium-disilicate ceramic crowns.

TI  - The Marginal Fit of CAD/CAM Monolithic Ceramic and Metal-Ceramic Crowns.
PG  - 299-304
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12590 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Studies on the marginal fit of monolithic restorations are limited. This
      study aimed to evaluate the marginal fit among monolithic zirconia, monolithic
      lithium disilicate, and conventional metal-ceramic crowns and to compare the
      buccal and lingual surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty standardized stainless
      steel master dies were fabricated (height: 5 mm; convergence: 6 degrees ;
      chamfer: 1 mm). The dies were randomly divided into three groups (n = 10 each)
      according to the material used to construct the crowns: group 1 (LM): Lava Plus; 
      group 2 (DM): IPS e.max CAD; and group 3 (MC): Metal-ceramic. The crowns were
      luted in a standard manner onto the stainless steel master dies using
      conventional glass ionomer cement. The vertical marginal gap of the restorations 
      was evaluated under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 500x magnification.
      One-way ANOVA, Tukey s HSD test, and Student's paired t test were used to assess 
      the marginal discrepancy among the groups. The cutoff value for statistical
      significance was set at alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: Significant differences among the 
      three groups (p = 0.0001) were recorded. DM group showed the lowest discrepancies
      (27.95 +/- 9.37 mum). Significant differences were observed for the buccal (p =
      0.007) and lingual (p = 0.0001) surfaces between the DM group and the other
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of fit achieved for the three groups was within
      the range of clinical acceptance. IPS e.max CAD showed the lowest discrepancies.

TI  - Monolithic CAD/CAM lithium disilicate versus veneered Y-TZP crowns: comparison of
      failure modes and reliability after fatigue.
PG  - 434-42
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this research was to evaluate the fatigue behavior and
      reliability of monolithic computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture
      (CAD/CAM) lithium disilicate and hand-layer-veneered zirconia all-ceramic crowns.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CAD-based mandibular molar crown preparation, fabricated
      using rapid prototyping, served as the master die. Fully anatomically shaped
      monolithic lithium disilicate crowns (IPS e.max CAD, n = 19) and
      hand-layer-veneered zirconia-based crowns (IPS e.max ZirCAD/Ceram, n = 21) were
      designed and milled using a CAD/CAM system. Crowns were cemented on aged
      dentinlike composite dies with resin cement. Crowns were exposed to mouth-motion 
      fatigue by sliding a WC-indenter (r = 3.18 mm) 0.7 mm lingually down the
      distobuccal cusp using three different step-stress profiles until failure
      occurred. Failure was designated as a large chip or fracture through the crown.
      If no failures occurred at high loads (> 900 N), the test method was changed to
      staircase r ratio fatigue. Stress level probability curves and reliability were
      calculated. RESULTS: Hand-layer-veneered zirconia crowns revealed veneer chipping
      and had a reliability of < 0.01 (0.03 to 0.00, two-sided 90% confidence bounds)
      for a mission of 100,000 cycles and a 200-N load. None of the fully anatomically 
      shaped CAD/CAM-fabricated monolithic lithium disilicate crowns failed during
      step-stress mouth-motion fatigue (180,000 cycles, 900 N). CAD/CAM lithium
      disilicate crowns also survived r ratio fatigue (1,000,000 cycles, 100 to 1,000
      N). There appears to be a threshold for damage/bulk fracture for the lithium
      disilicate ceramic in the range of 1,100 to 1,200 N. CONCLUSION: Based on present
      fatigue findings, the application of CAD/CAM lithium disilicate ceramic in a
      monolithic/fully anatomical configuration resulted in fatigue-resistant crowns,
      whereas hand-layer-veneered zirconia crowns revealed a high susceptibility to
      mouth-motion cyclic loading with early veneer failures.

TI  - Comparison of chairside and laboratory CAD/CAM to conventional produced
      all-ceramic crowns regarding morphology, occlusion, and aesthetics.
PG  - 791-7
LID - 10.1007/s00784-015-1554-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are many ways to produce all-ceramic crowns. Computer-aided
      design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) procedures compete against
      conventional fabricated restorations. As different methods of production may
      produce variable results, this study aims to compare chairside and
      laboratory-based CAD/CAM systems to conventional crowns regarding their
      similarity to original tooth morphology, number of occlusal contacts, occlusal
      adjustment time, and subjective aesthetic perception. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Impressions of caries-free jaws were taken, and the resulting gypsum casts were
      scanned with a laboratory scanner. Preparations for all-ceramic full crowns were 
      performed on first molars, and three different restorations were made: CEREC
      restorations (CER), laboratory-produced CAD/CAM crowns (LABCAD), and conventional
      waxed-up/pressed ceramic crowns (CONV). Time for occlusal adaptation and the
      number of occlusal contacts were noted. Two dentists performed aesthetic gradings
      of restorations. Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA with least
      significant difference (LSD) post hoc test, t test, and Kruskal-Wallis test.
      RESULTS: Metrical deviations of the re-scanned crowns to the original, unprepared
      tooth surface were 220.55 +/- 54.31 mum for CER, 265.94 +/- 61.39 for LABCAD, and
      252.44 +/- 68.77 mum for CONV group. One-way ANOVA showed significant lower
      deviations for the CER group. LABCAD crowns showed significantly more occlusal
      contacts, whereas CONV crowns required the least time for occlusal adaptation and
      showed excellent aesthetic gradings. CONCLUSION: All three methods had pros and
      cons regarding different parameters. Further improvements of CAD/CAM software
      shall lead to restorations comparable to conventional restorations in all
      aspects, especially in aesthetics. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: All tested methods of
      production for all-ceramic crowns produced clinically acceptable results. Thus,
      in an individual case, the method chosen can be determined by the dentist's
      preference.

TI  - Complications and survival rates of inlays and onlays vs complete coverage
      restorations: A systematic review and analysis of studies.
PG  - 903-920
LID - 10.1111/joor.12695 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify if different types of indirect
      restorations used for single teeth had different biological and technical
      complications, as well as survival rates. METHOD: An electronic search was
      performed in various electronic databases to identify articles, published between
      1980 and 2017. The search terms were categorised into 4 groups: inlay, onlay,
      inlay/onlay and crown. Manual searches of published full-text articles and
      related reviews were also performed. RESULTS: A total number of 2849 papers were 
      retrieved initially. After a detailed assessment for eligibility, 9 studies were 
      selected for inclusion. The heterogeneity of the studies did allow neither a
      meta-analysis nor any meaningful comparison between types of restorations or
      materials. Only some pooling was performed for representative reasons. The mean
      survival rate of inlays was 90.89%, while for onlays and crowns it was 93.50% and
      95.38%, respectively. For the fourth study group, consisting of both inlays and
      onlays, the survival rate was found to be 99.43%. Statistical analysis
      demonstrated caries to be the main biological complication for all types of
      restorations, followed by a root and/or tooth fracture incidence (11.34%) and
      endodontic incidence. Ceramic fractures represented the most common technical
      complication, followed by loss of retention and porcelain chipping. CONCLUSION:
      The 5-year survival rate for crowns and inlays/onlays is very high, exceeding
      90%. An association between the kind of complications and different types of
      restorations could not be established. Nevertheless, a relatively high failure
      rate due to caries and ceramic fractures was noted.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A systematic review was conducted to evaluate clinical (survival) and
      in vitro (fracture strength) studies of endocrown restorations compared to
      conventional treatments (intraradicular posts, direct composite resin,
      inlay/onlay). DATA: This report followed the PRISMA Statement. A total of 8
      studies were included in this review. SOURCES: Two reviewers performed a
      literature search up to February 2016 in seven databases: PubMed, Web of Science,
      Scopus, BBO, SciELO, LILACS and IBECS. STUDY SELECTION: Only clinical trials and 
      in vitro studies that evaluated endocrowns were included. Case reports, case
      series, pilot studies, reviews and in vitro studies that evaluated properties
      other than fracture strength of endocrowns were excluded. From the 103 eligible
      articles, 8 remained in the qualitative analysis (3 clinical trials and 5 in
      vitro studies), and the meta-analysis was performed for the 5 in vitro studies. A
      global comparison was performed with random-effects models at a significance
      level of p<0.05. RESULTS: Clinical trials showed a success rate of endocrowns
      varying from 94 to 100%. The global analysis in posterior and anterior teeth
      demonstrated that endocrowns had higher fracture strength than conventional
      treatments (p=0.03). However, when comparing endocrowns to conventional
      treatments only in posterior teeth (subgroup analyses), no statistically
      significant differences were found between treatments (p=0.07; I(2)=62%).
      CONCLUSION: The literature suggests that endocrowns may perform similarly or
      better than the conventional treatments using intraradicular posts, direct
      composite resin or inlay/onlay restorations. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although
      further studies are still necessary to confirm the present findings, endocrowns
      show potential application for the rehabilitation of severely compromised,
      endodontically treated teeth.

TI  - Effect of fiber posts on the fracture resistance of maxillary central incisors
      with Class III restorations: An in vitro study.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Endodontically treated teeth with Class III restorations
      show reduced fracture resistance. The placement of glass fiber posts may affect
      fracture resistance and should be further evaluated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of fiber posts on the fracture
      resistance of endodontically treated maxillary central incisors with Class III
      restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty extracted human maxillary central
      incisors were selected and divided into 4 test groups (n=10 each) according to
      the restoration strategy: control group; endodontically treated teeth without
      endodontic posts (GHT); endodontically treated teeth with 2 Class III
      restorations simulating coronal destruction (GCT); endodontically treated teeth
      with 2 Class III restorations and a carbon fiber post (GCF); and endodontically
      treated teeth with 2 Class III restorations and a glass-fiber post (GGF). The
      fiber posts were adhesively cemented with composite resin cement, and the
      cavities were restored with composite resin. After 3 months of water storage, all
      specimens were loaded at 45 degrees in a universal testing machine until fracture
      and evaluated for fracture mode. The data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA,
      followed by the Tukey honest significant difference multiple comparisons test
      (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Mean +/-SD failure loads ranged from 687.5 +/-84.0 N to
      943.8 +/-93.1 N. One-way ANOVA revealed a statistically signi fi cant difference 
      among the groups (P</=.05). The control group (GHT) had significantly higher
      resistance to fracture than the other groups (P</=.05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the
      limitations of this in vitro study, placement of a fiber post did not affect the 
      fracture resistance of endodontically treated maxillary central incisors with 2
      Class III restorations.

TI  - [The use of CAD/CAM system with zirconia in modern prosthodontics].
PG  - 337-44
AB  - Computer assisted design/computer assisted machining (CAD/CAM) technology has
      received considerable clinical and research interest from modern dental practices
      as a means of delivering all-ceramic restorations. Up to now the CAD/CAM system
      with zirconia has the highest fracture strength in all all-ceramic materials, and
      consistently enabled the most esthetic, lifelike reproduction of natural
      dentition. They have been widely received by both dentists and patients. The
      CAD/CAM system with zirconia is indicated for crowns and bridges in natural teeth
      or implants and telescope dentures, the CAD/CAM with zirconia can be placed
      anywhere in the mouth, and can replace the porcelain crowns and bridges for
      single crown and bridges less than 6 units. This paper described the techniques
      of CAD/CAM system with zirconia in fabrication of crowns, bridges, telescope
      dentures and implant dentures with colored illustrations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the adaptation of different lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic crown and whether different fabrication processes affect the
      adaptation of crowns. METHODS: Thirty epoxy dies crowns were divided into 3
      groups. They were cemented to domestic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic crowns in
      Group A, to IPS e.max CAD crowns in Group B and to IPS e.max Press crowns in
      Group C respectively. All crowns were cut by cutting machine. A confocal laser
      scanning microscope was used to measure the gap between crown tissue surface and 
      die. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the three groups of
      measurement points(P<0.05). Within the groups, specimens in group A showed in the
      lowest marginal fit([46.8+/-9.1] mum). Those in group B showed the lowest
      shoulder suitability([59.3+/-7.9] mum), axial plane([50.5+/-3.6] mum) and
      occlusal surface([87.6+/-11.6 mum]. Those in group C demonstrated the lowest
      axial plane angle[(84.4+/-10.1) mum]. In addition to the axial plane angle, the
      CAD/CAM system exhibited good accuracy of fit. CONCLUSIONS: The three groups of
      lithium disilicate glass-ceramic crowns appeared to have clinically acceptable
      fit.

LID - S0300-5712(16)30042-2 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This randomized clinical trial compared the survival of composite
      resin restorations and metal-ceramic crowns on endodontically treated teeth that 
      received a glass fiber post using 2 different cementation methods. METHODS:
      Forty-seven patients (age 42.5 +/- 11.5) with fifty-seven endodontically treated 
      teeth with extensive coronal damage but always with one intact surface were
      randomly allocated according to the type of coronal restoration: metal-ceramic
      crown or composite resin. In case of crown restoration, a core buildup was
      performed with microhybrid composite resin. The dentin bonding agent and
      composite resin used were the same for both direct and indirect restorations.
      Descriptive analysis was performed using FDI clinical criteria and survival of
      restorations/teeth analyzed using Kaplan-Meier statistics and log-rank tests.
      RESULTS: 57 restorations (30 composite resin and 27 crowns) were made in 47
      patients. The recall rate was 100% and follow up time ranged between 1 and 5
      years. One tooth was extracted 11 months post-restoration due to root fracture
      (composite group). Eight composite restorations and one crown had reparable
      failures, all due to secondary caries or restoration fracture. The overall annual
      failure rate (AFR) was 0.92% after 50 months for success of the restorations,
      with 1.83% for the composite group and 0.26% for the metal-ceramic crown group.
      The log-rank test showed no difference for survival according to the type of
      restoration (p=0.344). However, for success rates, metal-ceramic crowns
      demonstrated better performance (p=0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Indirect restorations
      provided higher acceptable clinical performance and lower need for
      re-intervention, but both types of restorations presented good survival rates.
      (NCT01461239). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: When endodontically treated teeth with at
      least one intact surface must be restored, composite resin restorations and
      metal-ceramic crows are acceptable alternatives to achieve good survival and
      success rates.

      thickness crowns cemented on e.max abutments. The 3Shape system was used to scan,
      design and mill all abutments and crowns with a die space set to 40 microm.
      Traditional thickness crowns were designed based on manufacturer guidelines with 
      1.5 mm occlusal thickness and 1.0 mm margins. Minimal thickness crowns were
      designed with 0.7 mm occlusal thickness and 0.5 mm margins. MZ100 composite and
      e.max abutments were selected to simulate dentin and enamel substrates,
      respectively, based on their elastic-modulus. Variolink Esthetic was used to
      cement all samples following manufacturer's instructions. A universal testing
      machine was used to load all specimens to fracture with a 3 mm radius stainless
      steel hemispherical tip at a crosshead speed 0.5 mm/minute along the longitudinal
      axis of the abutment with a 1 mm thermoplastic film placed between the loading
      tip and crown surface. Data was analyzed using ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc
      assessment. Fractographic analysis was performed with scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: The mean fracture load (standard deviation) was 1499
      (241) N for TD; 1228 (287) N for MD; and 1377 (96) N for ME. Statistically
      significant difference between groups did not exist (p = 0.157, F = 1.995). In
      groups TD and MD with low e-modulus abutments, the dispersion of a probability
      distribution (coefficient of variation: CV) was statistically higher than that of
      group ME with high e-modulus abutments. SEM illustrated larger micro-fracture
      dimensions in Group MD than Group ME. CONCLUSION: Minimal thickness e.max crowns 
      did not demonstrate statistical difference in fracture resistance from
      traditional thickness crowns. Fracture mechanisms of minimal thickness e.max
      crowns may be affected by the e-modulus of the substrate. Minimal thickness e.max
      crowns may be a viable restorative option when supported by high e-modulus
      materials.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Conventional impression materials and techniques have been 
      used successfully to fabricate fixed restorations. Recently, digital pathways
      have been developed, but insufficient data are available regarding their marginal
      accuracy. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the marginal
      gap discrepancy of lithium disilicate single crowns fabricated with
      computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology by
      using both conventional and 2 digital impression techniques. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: One typodont maxillary right central incisor was prepared for a ceramic 
      crown. Ten impressions were made by using each method: conventional with
      polyvinyl siloxane impression material, Lava COS (3M ESPE), and iTero (Cadent)
      intraoral scanning devices. Lithium disilicate (e.max CAD) crowns were fabricated
      with CAD/CAM technology, and the marginal gap was measured for each specimen at 4
      points under magnification with a stereomicroscope. The mean measurement for each
      location and overall mean gap size by group were calculated. Statistically
      significant differences among the impression techniques were tested with F and t 
      tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The average (+/-SD) gap for the conventional
      impression group was 112.3 (+/-35.3) mum. The digital impression groups had
      similar average gap sizes; the Lava group was 89.8 (+/-25.4) mum, and the iTero
      group was 89.6 (+/-30.1) mum. No statistically significant difference was found
      in the effects among impression techniques (P=.185) CONCLUSIONS: Within the
      limitations of this study, digital and conventional impressions were found to
      produce crowns with similar marginal accuracy.

TI  - Fracture Resistance of Titanium, Zirconia, and Ceramic-Reinforced
      Polyetheretherketone Implant Abutments Supporting CAD/CAM Monolithic Lithium
      Disilicate Ceramic Crowns After Aging.
PG  - 622-630
LID - 10.11607/jomi.7036 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the fracture resistances and
      the fracture types of titanium, zirconia, and ceramic-reinforced
      polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implant abutments supporting CAD/CAM monolithic
      lithium disilicate ceramic crowns after in vitro dynamic loading and
      thermocycling aging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three implant abutment (SKY Implant) 
      groups-titanium (group Ti, control); zirconia with titanium base (group Zr); and 
      ceramic-reinforced PEEK (BioHPP) with titanium base (group RPEEK); n = 12
      each-were used. Thirty-six CAD/CAM monolithic lithium disilicate crowns (IPS
      e.max CAD) in the form of a maxillary central incisor were cemented with Panavia 
      V5 on the abutments. The specimens were subjected to dynamic loading and
      thermocycling. Fracture resistances of the restorations were tested with a
      universal testing machine (0.5 mm/min), and their fracture patterns were
      analyzed. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test were used for statistical
      analyses (alpha = .05). RESULTS: All samples survived after aging. The fracture
      strength values (mean +/- standard deviation) of the groups were as follows:
      group Ti, 787.8 +/- 120.9 N; group Zr, 623.9 +/- 97.4 N; and group RPEEK, 602.9
      +/- 121 N. The fracture strengths were significantly higher in group Ti compared 
      to groups Zr and RPEEK (P = .001). No significant difference was observed between
      groups Zr and RPEEK. Failures generally occurred due to fracture of the screw in 
      group Ti, abutment and crown in group Zr, and crown in group RPEEK. CONCLUSION:
      Ceramic-reinforced PEEK abutments may be an alternative to zirconia abutments
      with a titanium base for single-implant restorations in the anterior region.
      However, there is need for further in vitro and clinical studies to evaluate the 
      long-term performance of ceramic-reinforced PEEK abutments.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Large tooth substance losses are frequent in posterior teeth because 
      of primary caries or aging restorations. Inlays and onlays are often the minimal 
      invasive solution in such cases, but the efficacy of the composite and ceramic
      materials used is unknown. We performed a systematic review of randomized
      controlled trials comparing the efficacy of composite and ceramic inlays or
      onlays. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials were searched without any restriction on date or language, as
      were references of eligible studies and ClinicalTrials.gov. STUDY SELECTION:
      Eligible studies were randomized trials comparing the clinical efficacy of
      composite to ceramic inlays or onlays in adults with any clinical outcome for at 
      least 6 months. From 172 records identified, we examined reports of 2 randomized 
      controlled trials involving 138 inlays (no onlays evaluated) in 80 patients and
      exhibiting a high-risk of bias. Outcomes were clinical scores and major failures.
      The 3-year overall failure risk ratio was 2 [0.38-10.55] in favor of ceramic
      inlays although not statistically significant. The reported clinical scores
      (United States Public Health Services and Californian Dental Association) showed 
      considerable heterogeneity between trials and could not be combined. CONCLUSIONS:
      We have very limited evidence that ceramics perform better than composite
      material for inlays in the short term. However, this result may not be valid in
      the long term, and other trials are needed. Trials should follow Federation
      dentaire internationale recommendations and enhance their methodology. Trials
      comparing composite and ceramic onlays are needed.

TI  - The Effect of Different Wax Pattern Fabrication Techniques on the Marginal Fit of
      Customized Lithium Disilicate Implant Abutments.
PG  - 1018-1023
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13112 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of different wax pattern fabrication techniques
      on the fit of customized pressed lithium disilicate implant abutments on titanium
      inserts before and after pressing. The marginal fit results of pressed lithium
      disilicate implant abutments were then compared with those of milled lithium
      disilicate abutments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After scanning the titanium inserts 
      and designing an implant abutment, wax patterns were fabricated with three
      techniques (n = 15 each): computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD/CAM) milling, 3D printing and conventional layering. The marginal fit
      (microm) was measured using a stereomicroscope for all the wax patterns before
      pressing them into the lithium disilicate abutments. The pressed implant
      abutments were measured again for marginal fit, and the results were compared to 
      those of the milled lithium disilicate abutments. One-way analysis of variance
      (ANOVA) was used to assess different wax pattern fabrication techniques in each
      stage before and after pressing. One-way ANOVA was also used to compare the
      groups of pressed and milled lithium disilicate abutments. Multiple pairwise
      comparisons were performed using the Tukey post hoc test in each stage. RESULTS: 
      There were statistically significant differences between the marginal fit of the 
      three wax patterns groups (p < 0.001; f = 123.33), wherein the mean marginal fit 
      was the highest for conventionally layered wax patterns (30 +/- 13.09) microm.
      Furthermore, after pressing, there were statistically significant differences
      between the marginal fit of the three pressed abutments groups (p < 0.001; f =
      518.62), wherein the mean marginal fit was the highest for pressed e.max
      abutments fabricated from conventionally layered wax patterns (25.26 +/- 3.9)
      microm. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean
      marginal fit of the pressed abutments fabricated from conventional layered wax
      patterns and that of the milled CAD/CAM abutments. However, the mean marginal fit
      of the milled CAD/CAM abutments was higher than that of the pressed abutments
      fabricated from both CAD/CAM wax and 3D printed wax. CONCLUSION: All the tested
      fabrication methods provided degrees of accuracy that lie well within accepted
      limits. The use of pressed lithium disilicate abutments fabricated from
      conventional layering wax pattern technique should provide a more consistent
      better marginal fit between the titanium insert and the abutment and may
      therefore be the preferable fabrication method.

AB  - The gathering of clinical data on fractures of dental restorations through
      prospective clinical trials is a labor- and time-consuming enterprise. Here, we
      propose an unconventional approach for collecting large datasets, from which
      clinical information on indirect restorations can be retrospectively analyzed.
      The authors accessed the database of an industry-scale machining center in
      Germany and obtained information on 34,911 computer-aided design
      (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) all-ceramic posterior restorations. The 
      fractures of bridges, crowns, onlays, and inlays fabricated from different
      all-ceramic systems over a period of 3.5 y were reported by dentists and entered 
      in the database. Survival analyses and estimations of future life revealed
      differences in performance among ZrO2-based restorations and lithium disilicate
      and leucite-reinforced glass-ceramics.

TI  - Clinical survival of chair-side generated monolithic lithium disilicate
      crowns:10-year results.
PG  - 1763-1769

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nowadays, all-ceramic materials are routinely used within the
      treatment of patients in dentistry. The objective of this prospective clinical
      trial was the evaluation of chair-side generated monolithic lithium disilicate
      crowns after 10 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one posterior full contour
      crowns made of lithium disilicate ceramics were inserted with a self-adhesive
      resin cement in 34 patients (20 university/14 private practice) using a
      chair-side CAD/CAM technique. One crown per patient was randomly selected for
      evaluation according to the modified US Public Health Service criteria. RESULTS: 
      After a mean examination time of 10.1 years, 26 crowns were available for
      re-examination. Within the observation period, five failures occurred due to one 
      crown fracture after 2.9 years, an abutment fracture after 6.0 years, one severe 
      endodontic problem after 6.1 years, a root fracture after 7.0 years, and a
      replacement of one crown caused by a carious lesion after 10 years. Complications
      occurred as retention loss of one crown, two carious lesions, and a change in
      sensibility perception of two abutment teeth. All events were associated with
      molars. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a survival rate of 83.5% and a
      complication-free rate of 71.0% after 10 years. CONCLUSION: Due to the small
      amount of technical complications and failures, the clinical performance of
      monolithic lithium disilicate crowns was completely satisfying. CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: The insertion of chair-side fabricated monolithic lithium disilicate
      crowns can be recommended for long-term use in the posterior region.

TI  - Fracture resistance of cingulum rest seats in CAD-CAM tooth-colored crowns for
      removable partial denture abutments.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The prevalent use of computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) for tooth-colored ceramic materials has
      led to several case reports and retrospective clinical studies of surveyed crowns
      used to support removable partial dentures. How the specific contour of a
      cingulum rest seat affects the fracture resistance of these CAD-CAM tooth-colored
      materials is unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare 
      the fracture resistance of monolithic CAD-CAM tooth-colored mandibular
      canine-surveyed ceramic crowns with cingulum rest seats of different designs.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five groups (n=24/group) of CAD-CAM tooth-colored crowns
      were milled from the same standard tessellation language (STL) file: group EM,
      lithium disilicate-based material (IPS e.max CAD CEREC blocks); group SM,
      zirconia-based material (NexxZr T); group LP, zirconia-based material (Lava Plus 
      High Translucency); group ZC, zirconia-based material (ZirCAD LT); and group MZ, 
      composite resin (MZ100 CEREC blocks), used as a control. Crowns from each group
      were divided into 2 subgroups representing 2 shapes of cingulum rest seat design:
      round design subgroup (n=12) with 0.5-mm radius of curvature and sharp design
      subgroup (n=12) with 0.25-mm radius of curvature for the rest seat preparation.
      The crowns were cemented with resin cement to a composite resin die on a steel
      nut. After 24 hours of storage in water at 37 degrees C, the specimens were
      statically loaded to fracture with a custom metal retainer on top of the cingulum
      rest seat by using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1.5
      mm/min. Two-way ANOVA and the Tukey honestly significant difference tests were
      used to control the familywise error rate (alpha=.05). Representative specimens
      were examined using an optical stereomicroscope at x10 magnification and a
      scanning electron microscope to determine the failure patterns and fracture
      mechanism. RESULTS: The results of the ANOVA test indicated statistically
      significant differences by materials and rest seat designs (P<.001). The mean
      +/-standard deviation maximal load capacity was 773.5 +/-255.0 N for group MZ,
      1124.9 +/-283.9 N for group EM, 2784.1 +/-400.5 N for group SM, 2526.9 +/-547.1 N
      for group LP, and 3200.8 +/-416.8 N for group ZC. The round design subgroups had 
      an approximately 30% higher mean failure load than the sharp design subgroups for
      all surveyed crowns. CONCLUSIONS: The present in vitro study demonstrated that
      zirconia-based groups fractured at twice the load as the lithium disilicate
      group. Of the 3 zirconia-based groups, group ZirCAD had a statistically greater
      fracture resistance than the other groups. Designing the cingulum rest seat to
      have a broad round shape provides a statistically significant higher fracture
      resistance than a sharp-shape design (P<.05).

TI  - Fracture load of CAD/CAM-fabricated and 3D-printed composite crowns as a function
      of material thickness.
PG  - 2777-2784
LID - 10.1007/s00784-018-2717-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Indirect CAD/CAM restorations can be fabricated using both
      subtractive and additive CAD/CAM technology. This study investigated the fracture
      load of crowns fabricated from three particle-filled composite CAD/CAM materials 
      and one 3D-printed composite material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lava Ultimate,
      Cerasmart and Brilliant Crios were used as particle-filled composite CAD/CAM
      material and els-3D Harz as 3D-printed composite material. For each group, crowns
      with three different material thicknesses (0.5/1.0/1.5 mm) were fabricated.
      Control group was composed of ceramic-based CAD/CAM materials e.max CAD and
      Enamic. Totally, n = 180 crowns were fabricated and adhesively seated on SLA
      fabricated dies. Thermomechanical loading and fracture testing were performed.
      The data for fracture loading force were statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA 
      followed with multiple comparisons by post hoc Tukey's test (alpha = 0.05).
      RESULTS: In contrast to ceramics, all particle-filled composite crowns with
      0.5-mm thickness survived fatigue testing. Forces varied statistically
      significantly. Brilliant Crios showed highest maximum loading force with 1580.4
      +/- 521.0 N (1.5 mm). Two-way ANOVA indicated that both the material and the
      thickness affected the fracture load (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Particle-filled
      composite resin CAD/CAM materials may have advantageous material characteristics 
      compared to ceramic CAD/CAM materials for minimal restoration thicknesses.
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Composite-based CAD/CAM materials may offer new possibilities
      in minimally invasive restorative treatment concepts.

TI  - Fracture Resistance of Molar Crowns Fabricated with Monolithic All-Ceramic
      CAD/CAM Materials Cemented on Titanium Abutments: An In Vitro Study.
PG  - 309-314
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12393 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the fracture resistance of single-tooth implant-supported
      crown restorations made with different CAD/CAM blocks. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Thirty-six titanium abutments were put on dental implant analogs (Mis Implant).
      For each of three test groups (n = 12/group), implant-supported, cement-retained 
      mandibular molar single crowns were produced. Crowns were made of lithium
      disilicate glass (LD) IPS e.max CAD, feldspathic glass ceramic (FEL) Vita Mark
      II, and resin nano-ceramic (RNC) Lava Ultimate. The crowns were cemented with
      self-adhesive resin cement RelyX Unicem 2. After chewing cycling, crowns were
      tested to failure in a universal testing machine. Fracture values were calculated
      as initial (F-initial) and maximum fracture (F-max). RESULTS: The study groups
      were ranked, in order of having highest value, (LD > FEL) > RNC for F-initial
      load value and (LD > RNC) > FEL for F-max load value. This demonstrated that
      there was no parallel change in the F-initial and F-max values presenting the
      fracture resistance of specimens. CONCLUSIONS: There was no accordance between
      the F-initial and F-max values of the LD, RNC, and FEL after chewing simulation
      with thermocycling resembling 5 years of clinical functional use. LD had the
      highest fracture resistance during the fracture test. RNC had low fracture
      resistance; however, it had considerably high fracture resistance during the
      fracture test. FEL had considerably low fracture resistance values.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The color of dental ceramics is important for achieving
      successful esthetic restorations. However, insufficient studies are available of 
      the color of recently introduced computer-aided design-computer-aided
      manufacturing (CAD-CAM) lithium disilicate ceramics as functions of the core and 
      veneer thicknesses. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate
      the effects of the thickness of different core and veneer thicknesses on the
      color of CAD-CAM lithium disilicate ceramics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 42
      specimens from 2 groups of 7 ceramic cores at 3 thicknesses (0.8, 1.0, and 1.2
      mm) were fabricated. The veneer was fabricated at 3 thicknesses (0.3, 0.5, and
      0.7 mm). The group name was based on the name of the ceramic core (IPS e.max CAD;
      lithium disilicate [LD], IPS Empress CAD; leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic [LR]),
      and the associated number was determined by the combined thicknesses of the core 
      and the veneer: 1=0.8+0.7; 2=1.0+0.5; and 3=1.2+0.3. The color coordinates and
      the color differences were calculated using a spectrophotometer. The color
      difference was analyzed using the CIEDE2000 chrominance and the acceptability
      threshold. Two-way ANOVA was used to identify the color difference based on the
      core/veneer thicknesses, and the Tukey honest significant differences and
      Games-Howell tests were conducted to verify the DeltaE00 differences of the group
      (alpha=.05). In addition, regression analysis was carried out to estimate the
      causal relationship between the independent variables and the chrominance.
      RESULTS: At a certain thickness, the color differences of LD1, LR1, and LR2 were 
      not clinically acceptable based on the thicknesses of the core and the veneer.
      Results of 2-way ANOVA demonstrated that the different thicknesses of core/veneer
      combination significantly affected the color difference (P<.05). A significant
      interaction was present between the thickness and the material (P<.05). The
      results of multiple regression analyses showed that the average color difference 
      of LR increased by 0.019 as the thickness of the core decreased by 0.2 mm.
      CONCLUSIONS: The color is influenced by the thicknesses of the core and the
      veneer. With a certain thickness, the color differences increased as the
      thickness of the core decreased, and lithium disilicate ceramics were less
      vulnerable to standard deviation of color difference compared with the
      leucite-reinforced ceramics.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Recent resin-based and ceramic-based computer-aided design 
      and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials have been used to restore
      endodontically treated teeth. Adaptation of the restoration is important for
      clinical success, but studies evaluating the effect of these materials on the
      adaptation of endocrowns are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study
      was to evaluate the effect of resin-based and ceramic-based materials on the
      marginal and internal adaptation of endocrowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty
      mandibular molars were divided into 4 groups (n=10); each group was restored with
      a different CAD-CAM material: group C: hybrid nanoceramic (Cerasmart; GC Corp),
      group T: fiber-composite material (Trilor; Bioloren Srl), group E: lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD; Ivoclar Vivadent AG), and group V:
      zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (Vita Suprinity; VITA
      Zahnfabrik GmbH). A digital scan was made with an intraoral digital scanner
      (TRIOS 3; 3Shape A/S), and endocrowns were milled with a 5-axis milling machine
      (Coritec 250i; imes-icore GmbH). The replica technique and a stereomicroscope
      (x70) were used to measure the marginal and internal adaptation of the endocrowns
      at 32 points. All data were statistically analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and the
      Tukey honestly significant difference test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Statistical
      tests showed significant differences among the tested groups (P<.001). The
      resin-based groups displayed larger discrepancies than the ceramic-based groups. 
      The resin-based groups showed a mean marginal gap larger than the mean internal
      gap C (P=.009), T (P<.001), whereas the ceramic-based groups showed similar gaps,
      V (P=.396), E (P=.936). The largest gap was observed at the pulpal floor
      (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: All materials had clinically acceptable internal and
      marginal gaps (</=150 mum), except for the marginal gap of the Trilor group.

AB  - An endocrown restoration is an alternative approach to complete crowns with
      intraradicular cores or dowels for the restoration of endodontically treated
      teeth. Endocrowns conserve tooth structure and require fewer dental visits. This 
      approach has been widely used, and various materials and techniques have been
      reported. Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM)
      systems can generate and store libraries of teeth with various anatomies in their
      database, and diagnostic tooth waxing may not be required. However, occlusal
      adjustments after the cementation of indirect restorations are often frustrating.
      Thus, a rapid and efficient way of addressing this challenge is necessary. This
      clinical report presents a protocol for the fabrication and delivery of an
      endocrown by using the biogeneric design mode with lithium silicate-based ceramic
      adjusted before its complete sintering.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to compare the fracture strength of endocrown
      restorations fabricated with different preparation depth and various CAD/CAM
      ceramics, and to assess the fracture types. Endodontically treated 100 extracted 
      human permanent maxillary centrals were divided into two preparation depth groups
      as short (S: 3-mm-deep) and long (L: 6-mm-deep), then five ceramic subgroups,
      namely: feldspathic-ceramic (Vita Mark II-VM2), lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic 
      (IPS e.max CAD-E.max), resin-ceramic (LAVA Ultimate-LU), polymer infiltrated
      ceramic (Vita Enamic-VE) and monoblock zirconia (inCoris TZI-TZI)
      (n=10/subgroup). The endocrowns were fabricated by CAD/CAM and were cemented with
      resin cement (RelyX U200). The teeth were thermally cycled (5,000cycles) and
      fracture tests were performed at 45 masculine angle to the teeth. The data were
      statistically analyzed (Kruskal-Wallis, Mann Whitney U), failure modes were
      evaluated with stereomicroscopy. Zirconia group provided the statistically
      highest fracture strength, but also exhibited non-repairable failures.
      Preparation depth has an effect on the fracture strength only for feldspathic
      ceramic.

TI  - Fracture resistance of all-ceramic crowns based on different preparation designs 
      for restoring endodontically treated molars.
PG  - 72-79
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12410 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate endodontically treated molar fracture resistance restored
      with CAD/CAM lithium disilicate (LDS) crowns with different amalgam core
      preparation design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-four recently extracted
      mandibular third molars were divided into seven groups (n = 12) and embedded in
      autopolymerizing resin. Coronal tooth structure was removed, pulp chamber
      exposed, and pulpal remnants removed. One group received LDS endocrowns, while
      three groups received amalgam cores with 2, 1, and 0 dentin axial wall heights
      (AWH). Three additional groups were likewise restored using an amalgam adhesive. 
      Scanned preparations were restored with LDS crowns luted with a self-adhesive
      luting cement. After 24 hours, specimens were loaded to failure with results
      analyzed with Welch's Test/REGW Range Test at a 95% level of confidence (alpha = 
      0.05). RESULTS: The 1 mm-AWH amalgam core group had the highest failure load and 
      was similar to the 2 mm-AWH amalgam, 2 mm-AWH bonded amalgam, and the 1 mm-AWH
      bonded amalgam core groups. The endocrowns had lower failure load than the 1 mm
      and 2 mm AWH amalgam groups but was similar to other groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Adhesively luted LDS crowns with amalgam core preparations overall displayed
      similar failure load, as endocrown restorations. However, crowns based on amalgam
      cores demonstrated favorable failure modes. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of
      this in vitro test suggests that when suitable tooth structure and sufficient
      interact restorative space exists, endodontically treated molars restored with
      lithium disilicate complete crowns based on preparations with amalgam core
      foundations containing 1 mm and 2 mm of dentin axial wall height could serve as a
      suitable restorative option that may provide more recoverable failure modes than 
      endocrown restorations.

      Standard-Tessellation-Language-(STL)-data-sets (one for the teeth and one for the
      crowns) were designed. The teeth were CAD/CAM-milled of human third molars and
      the crowns of three different CAD/CAM composite blocks (Lava Ultimate,'LU';
      Brilliant Crios'BC'; Cerasmart,'CS'), one polymer-infiltrated-ceramic network
      (Vita Enamic,'VE') and a control group of lithium disilicate ceramics (IPS e.max 
      CAD,'EM'). Crowns were adhesively cemented with their corresponding luting system
      on the human teeth. Half of the specimens were light-cured ('LC') and the others 
      were chemical-cured ('CC'). A mouth-motion-simulator (WL-tec, 2 Hz, 37 degrees C)
      applied dynamic cyclic loading between 50-500 N for a period of 1 million cycles.
      Afterwards, a dye penetration test (aqueous basic-fuchsine) revealed damage of
      test specimens. Each specimen was sectioned into four equidistant slices and the 
      area without damage was measured with a digital microscope (Zeiss) and radial
      cracks at the cementation surface were assessed. Data were subjected to Tukey's
      test. RESULTS: All specimens showed fatigue damage in the occlusal contact area. 
      LU, BC and CS exhibited a significant greater area without damage compared to VE 
      and EM (p < .05). EM and VE showed additional radial cracks at the cementation
      interface in both curing modes, whereas LU, BC and CS showed only radial cracks
      with chemical-cured luting cement. CONCLUSIONS: Monolithic CAD/CAM composite
      crowns showed significantly lower fatigue damage, particularly if the luting
      system was light-cured.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and to compare the clinical performance and survival rate
      of posterior monolithic and veneered zirconia fixed partial dentures (FPDs).
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty 3-unit posterior FPDs were included in the study. The
      patients were randomly distributed into two groups (n = 30 each) to receive
      either a monolithic (Zenostar T, Wieland Dental) or veneered zirconia (IPS e.max 
      ZirCAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) FPD. Each patient received only 1 FPD. Tooth
      preparations were scanned (Trios 3, 3Shape), designed (Dental System 2016, 3
      Shape), milled (Zenotec CAM 3.2, Wieland Dental), and cemented with a resin
      cement. Technical and biological outcomes and periodontal parameters were
      assessed. Data analysis was made using the Friedman and the Wilcoxon signed-rank 
      tests with the Bonferroni correction and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The
      survival rate at 3 years was 100% for veneered and 90% for monolithic zirconia
      restorations. Three monolithic zirconia FPDs were lost because of biologic
      complications. The main complication in the veneered zirconia FPDs was the
      fracture of the veneering ceramic in 4 of the veneered zirconia FPDs. No fracture
      of the frameworks was observed in any of the groups. All restorations were
      assessed as satisfactory after 3 years. No differences in periodontal parameters 
      were observed between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest 
      that monolithic zirconia and complete digital flow could be a viable alternative 
      to veneered zirconia in the posterior regions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The monolithic
      zirconia restorations with a digital workflow can be a viable alternative in
      posterior fixed partial dentures, with good periodontal outcomes. CLINICAL TRIAL

      survival after 6 years.
PG  - 2083-2089
LID - 10.1007/s00784-016-1998-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the 
      clinical performance of chair-side generated monolithic lithium disilicate crowns
      after 72 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one posterior full contour crowns
      made of lithium disilicate ceramic were inserted in 34 patients with a chair-side
      CAD/CAM technique. One crown per patient was randomly selected for evaluation at 
      baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 months according to the modified US Public
      Health Service criteria. RESULTS: After a mean examination time of 73.2 months
      (SD +/- 1.7 months), 25 crowns were available for re-examination. Within the
      observation period, three failures occurred due to one crown fracture after 2.9
      years, an abutment fracture after 6.0 years, and one severe endodontic problem
      after 6.1 years. One lithium disilicate crown showed a loss of retention after 2 
      years but could be reinserted. There were two events of caries below the crown
      margin, one after 24 and another one after 48 months. Both teeth received
      cervical adhesive composite fillings. Two abutment teeth changed their
      sensibility perception from positive to negative within the first 13 months. The 
      failure-free rate was 87.6%, and the complication-free rate was 70.1% after 6
      years according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the fact that
      there was only one severe technical complication and the severe biological
      complications were in a normal range, the clinical performance of monolithic
      lithium disilicate crowns in the posterior region was completely satisfying.
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The chair-side application of monolithic lithium disilicate
      crowns can be recommended.

TI  - Influence of crown design and material on chipping-resistance of all-ceramic
      molar crowns: An in vitro study.
PG  - 35-42
LID - 10.17219/dmp/85000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: All-ceramic restorations have become popular and the trend is
      ongoing. However, the incidence of chipping within the veneering layer has been a
      commonly reported failure in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in
      vitro study was to evaluate the effect of ceramic crown design (monolithic vs
      bi-layered) and material on the chipping resistance of molar crowns submitted to 
      compressive cyclic loading. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty identical epoxy resin
      replicas of a mandibular first molar with crown preparation were divided into 5
      groups (n = 10) as follows: the MLD group - monolithic CAD/CAM lithium-disilicate
      glass-ceramic (LDGC) crowns; 30 zirconia cores were veneered with either
      feldspathic porcelain by hand-layering technique (ZHL) or by heat-pressing
      technique (ZVP), or with milled LDGC veneers and subsequently fused to the cores 
      (ZLD); 10 porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crowns acted as a control group. All
      crowns were cemented using Panavia(R) F2.0 resin cement (Kuraray Dental, Tokyo,
      Japan). After storage in water at 37 degrees C for 1 week, the specimens were
      subjected to compressive cyclic loading at the mesiobuccal cusp which was tilted 
      at 30 degrees . A load cycle of 50-450 N was used and specimens were maintained
      in an aqueous environment throughout 500,000 cycles in a universal testing
      machine (Instron, Norwood, USA). The data was statistically analyzed at 5%
      significant level with Fisher's exact test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
      RESULTS: Significant differences in survival rates of the specimens used in the
      groups (p < 0.001) were found. Specimens of the PFM, ZHL and ZVP groups underwent
      failures at different stages of the 500,000 fatigue cycles, while specimens of
      the MLD and ZLD groups survived the entire fatigue test. ZHL and ZVP crowns had
      the worst chipping-resistance, while PFM crowns performed slightly better. The
      Kaplan-Meier test revealed significantly higher survival rates for the MLD and
      ZLD specimens compared to the other 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of LDGC as a
      monolithic molar crown and as a veneer over a zirconia core resulted in superior 
      resistance to cuspal chipping.

TI  - The effect of fiber post presence and restorative technique on the biomechanical 
      behavior of endodontically treated maxillary incisors: an in vitro study.
PG  - 147-57
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(12)60138-3 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Unresolved controversy exists concerning the best technique
      for restoring endodontically treated teeth. Prefabricated posts have been
      recommended with some debate as a method of restoring pulpless teeth before
      placement of the final restoration. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study
      was to evaluate the effect on the strain, fracture resistance, and fracture mode 
      of endodontically treated human incisors of 4 types of restorations with or
      without glass fiber posts after thermal cycling. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety
      human maxillary central incisors were selected and divided into 1 control group
      and 8 treatment groups (n=10). The teeth were endodontically treated and received
      2 large Class III preparations simulating coronal destruction. The teeth were
      then restored with or without glass fiber posts and by using 4 restorative
      techniques: direct composite resin, direct composite veneer, feldspathic ceramic 
      veneer, or a feldspathic ceramic crown. After artificial aging by thermal
      cycling, the incisors were loaded at a 135-degree angle, and the strain was
      measured by using strain gauges placed on the facial and proximal root surfaces. 
      Specimens were subsequently loaded to the point of fracture. Strain and fracture 
      resistance results were analyzed by a 1-way and 2-way ANOVA, followed by the
      Tukey HSD and Dunnett tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: One-way analyses showed that
      the control group and the direct composite resin restoration with and without
      post groups presented significantly higher fracture resistance values (P<.001).
      Two-way analyses showed no significant differences for the post system. Proximal 
      strain values were higher in the control and composite resin groups and lower in 
      the feldspathic ceramic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of glass fiber posts
      did not increase the fracture resistance of endodontically treated incisors.
      Conservative composite resin restorations showed higher fracture resistance
      values.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Assessing the long-term stainability and durability of
      restorative materials is an important parameter for determining clinical success 
      and longevity. Information remains limited regarding the color stainability and
      translucency of the recently introduced ceramic materials for restorative
      treatment. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the effect 
      of cyclic immersion in hot and cold coffee on the color stainability and
      translucency of 6 computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD-CAM) restorative materials at thicknesses which represent a laminate veneer 
      and a complete crown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CAD-CAM restorative materials
      including zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic (Celtra Duo), lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD), polymerized resin nanoceramic (Lava
      Ultimate), integrated ceramic and acrylate polymer network material (VITA
      ENAMIC), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (VITA SUPRINITY), and zirconia
      (VITA YZ HT) were studied in 2 thicknesses for laminate veneer (0.7 mm) and
      complete crown application (1.3 mm to 1.5 mm). For each specimen, color
      difference on a gray backing was calculated using a spectroradiometer between its
      baseline color and after 6000 cycles of coffee thermocycling. The colors of the
      specimens on the black and white backings were used to calculate the relative
      translucency parameter from the CIEDE2000 color difference formula. An ANOVA and 
      the Bonferroni-corrected Student t tests were used for testing statistical
      significance (alpha=.05). RESULTS: No difference was found among the means of
      color change after coffee thermocycling between any 2 materials for the crown
      thickness (P>.999), and no difference was found among the means of color change
      between the 2 thickness groups within each material (P>/=.187). However, the mean
      color change of the resin nanoceramic material in laminate veneer application
      (0.7 mm) was greater than that of every other material in the veneer thickness
      group (P<.001), and the mean color change of the integrated ceramic and acrylate 
      polymer network material was greater than that of the lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic material studied at the veneer thickness (P=.014). Translucency was
      found to be lower for complete crown thickness compared with laminate veneer
      thickness within each combination of material and coffee thermocycling (P<.001). 
      The translucency of the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic material studied at the 
      laminate veneer thickness was also found to be higher after coffee thermocycling 
      (P=.033). Furthermore, several differences among materials were found for each
      combination of thickness and coffee. CONCLUSIONS: Color change after coffee
      thermocycling of the resin nanoceramic material was beyond the acceptability
      threshold. The lower translucency found for crown thickness compared with veneer 
      thickness was verified.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The demand for ceramic restorations has increased over the 
      past years, and now various machinable materials can be used for chairside
      computer-aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) systems. Limited
      studies of these new materials make it difficult to evaluate their mechanical
      performance, advantages, and limitations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro
      study was to investigate the fracture resistance of CAD-CAM monolithic ceramic
      and veneered zirconia molar crowns after thermomechanical aging. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: A mandibular first molar tooth was prepared, and 12 different
      experimental groups were generated (n=10). An aging procedure was performed by
      subjecting the specimens to 12x10(5) mechanical cycles and 5000 thermocycles.
      Survival analysis was performed according to the thermomechanical aging. The
      fracture resistance (load at fracture) of all specimens was evaluated with 1-way 
      analysis of variance after the means had been compared using the Tukey honest
      significant difference test and Weibull distributions of the experimental groups 
      (alpha=.05). RESULTS: According to the results, the differences between the
      fracture resistance of the groups were found to be significant. Restorations in
      the dual network ceramic crown group fractured catastrophically during
      thermomechanical aging. In all groups, the highest value was found for monolithic
      zirconia, followed by monolithic lithium disilicate crowns (P<.05). Both of the
      monolithic crowns made of lithium disilicate derivates and zirconia crowns
      veneered with lithium disilicate ceramic showed no differences from each other
      (P>.05). The Weibull modulus (m) ranged from 4.22 to 8.58, and conventionally
      veneered and overpressed zirconia showed the lowest Weibull modulus values among 
      the tested groups, indicating greater variation of the data. CONCLUSIONS: The
      highest fracture resistance was observed for yttria-stabilized zirconia crowns,
      followed by lithium disilicate derivates. Veneered zirconia restorations
      generally showed lower resistance than these ceramics. The dual network ceramic
      crowns fractured during thermomechanical aging.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term clinical outcome of posterior metal-ceramic
      crowns fabricated with CAD/CAM-based laser-sintering technology (BEGO Medical,
      Bremen, Germany). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty posterior crowns were placed in 39
      patients. After tooth preparation, impression taking and model casting, the stone
      dies were scanned to create STL data, followed by manufacturing of crown
      frameworks with laser-sintering technology. A base metal alloy (CoCr) and a
      precious alloy (AuPt) were used for 31 and 29 posterior crowns, respectively,
      which were veneered using the layering technique. All crowns were cemented using 
      glass-ionomer cement. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 10.5+/-3.9 years. 
      Six patients with 10 crowns were regarded as dropout. Nine crowns had been
      removed, three of them were intact but they were removed due to a new prosthetic 
      treatment plan. The cumulative survival rate of all crowns was 81% after 14.7
      years. When comparing the survival rates related to the alloy used, the
      Gehan-Wilcoxon test showed no significant differences between both alloys.
      Biological complications were most commonly reported, while technical
      complications did not affect the function of the crowns. CONCLUSION: The
      long-term clinical outcome of posterior metal-ceramic crowns fabricated with
      CAD/CAM-based laser-sintering technology is very promising, so that this novel
      technique could be an alternative to the traditional lost wax casting process.

LID - 10.1111/jopr.12130 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the fracture resistance
      (FR), flexural strength (FS), and shear bond strength (SBS) of zirconia framework
      material veneered with different methods and to assess the stress distributions
      using finite element analysis (FEA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Zirconia frameworks
      fabricated in the forms of crowns for FR, bars for FS, and disks for SBS (N = 90,
      n = 10) were veneered with either (a) file splitting (CAD-on) (CD), (b) layering 
      (L), or (c) overpressing (P) methods. For crown specimens, stainless steel dies
      (N = 30; 1 mm chamfer) were scanned using the labside contrast spray. A bilayered
      design was produced for CD, whereas a reduced design (1 mm) was used for L and P 
      to support the veneer by computer-aided design and manufacturing. For bar (1.5 x 
      5 x 25 mm(3) ) and disk (2.5 mm diameter, 2.5 mm height) specimens, zirconia
      blocks were sectioned under water cooling with a low-speed diamond saw and
      sintered. To prepare the suprastructures in the appropriate shapes for the three 
      mechanical tests, nano-fluorapatite ceramic was layered and fired for L,
      fluorapatite-ceramic was pressed for P, and the milled lithium-disilicate
      ceramics were fused with zirconia by a thixotropic glass ceramic for CD and then 
      sintered for crystallization of veneering ceramic. Crowns were then cemented to
      the metal dies. All specimens were stored at 37 degrees C, 100% humidity for 48
      hours. Mechanical tests were performed, and data were statistically analyzed
      (ANOVA, Tukey's, alpha = 0.05). Stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy
      (SEM) were used to evaluate the failure modes and surface structure. FEA modeling
      of the crowns was obtained. RESULTS: Mean FR values (N +/- SD) of CD (4408 +/-
      608) and L (4323 +/- 462) were higher than P (2507 +/- 594) (p < 0.05). Mean FS
      values (MPa +/- SD) of CD (583 +/- 63) and P (566 +/- 54) were higher than L (428
      +/- 41) (p < 0.05). Mean SBS values (MPa +/- SD) of CD (49 +/- 6) (p < 0.05) were
      higher than L (28 +/- 5) and P (30 +/- 8). For crown restorations, while cohesive
      failures within ceramic and zirconia were seen in CD, cohesive failures within
      ceramic were found in both L and P. Results were verified by FEA. CONCLUSION: The
      file splitting technique showed higher bonding values in all mechanical tests,
      whereas a layering technique increased the FR when an anatomical core design was 
      employed. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: File splitting (CAD-on) or layering veneering
      ceramic on zirconia with a reduced framework design may reduce ceramic chipping.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Further investigations are required to evaluate the mechanical
      behaviour of newly developed polymer-matrix composite (PMC) blocks for
      computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of elasticity on the stress
      distribution in dental crowns made of glass-ceramic and PMC materials using
      finite element (FE) analysis. METHODS: Elastic constants of two materials were
      determined by ultrasonic pulse velocity using an acoustic thickness gauge.
      Three-dimensional solid models of a full-coverage dental crown on a first
      mandibular molar were generated based on X-ray micro-CT scanning images. A
      variety of load case-material property combinations were simulated and conducted 
      using FE analysis. The first principal stress distribution in the crown and
      luting agent was plotted and analyzed. RESULTS: The glass-ceramic crown had
      stress concentrations on the occlusal surface surrounding the area of loading and
      the cemented surface underneath the area of loading, while the PMC crown had only
      stress concentration on the occlusal surface. The PMC crown had lower maximum
      stress than the glass-ceramic crown in all load cases, but this difference was
      not substantial when the loading had a lateral component. Eccentric loading did
      not substantially increase the maximum stress in the prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS:
      Both materials are resistant to fracture with physiological occlusal load. The
      PMC crown had lower maximum stress than the glass-ceramic crown, but the effect
      of a lateral loading component was more pronounced for a PMC crown than for a
      glass-ceramic crown. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Knowledge of the stress distribution 
      in dental crowns with low modulus of elasticity will aid clinicians in planning
      treatments that include such restorations.

AB  - Esthetic high-strength lithium disilicate glass ceramics (LDGC) are used for
      monolithic crowns and bridges produced in dental CAD/CAM and oral adjusting
      processes, which machinability affects the restorative quality. A machinability
      study has been made in the simulated oral clinical machining of LDGC with a
      dental handpiece and diamond burs, regarding the diamond tool wear and chip
      control, machining forces and energy, surface finish and integrity. Machining
      forces, speeds and energy in in vitro dental adjusting of LDGC were measured by a
      high-speed data acquisition and force sensor system. Machined LDGC surfaces were 
      assessed using three-dimensional non-contact chromatic confocal optical
      profilometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Diamond bur morphology and
      LDGC chip shapes were also examined using SEM. Minimum tool wear but significant 
      LDGC chip accumulations were found. Machining forces and energy significantly
      depended on machining conditions (p<0.05) and were significantly higher than
      other glass ceramics (p<0.05). Machining speeds dropped more rapidly with
      increased removal rates than other glass ceramics (p<0.05). Two material
      machinability indices associated with the hardness, Young's modulus and fracture 
      toughness were derived based on the normal force-removal rate relations, which
      ranked LDGC the most difficult to machine among glass ceramics. Surface roughness
      for machined LDGC was comparable for other glass ceramics. The removal mechanisms
      of LDGC were dominated by penetration-induced brittle fracture and shear-induced 
      plastic deformation. Unlike most other glass ceramics, distinct intergranular and
      transgranular fractures of lithium disilicate crystals were found in LDGC. This
      research provides the fundamental data for dental clinicians on the machinability
      of LDGC in intraoral adjustments.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the fracture
      strength and failure modes of endocrowns, zirconia post, and fiber post supported
      restorations and predict the clinical outcomes of six different prostheses used
      for endodontically treated teeth. Sixty (n=10) maxillary central incisors were
      restored with zirconia post/resin-nano-ceramic crown (ZrRNC), fiber
      post/resinnano-ceramic crown (FbRNC), zirconia post/lithium disilicate ceramic
      crown (ZrLDS), fiber post/lithium disilicate ceramic crown (FbLDS),
      resin-nano-ceramic endocrown (EndoRNC), and lithium disilicate ceramic endocrown 
      (EndoLDS). Fracture strength test was performed. Fracture loads and modes were
      determined. The EndoLDS group had the highest fracture strength, followed by
      ZrRNC and EndoRNC group. However the results were not significantly different
      among groups (p>0.05). The failure modes of the restorations changed according to
      the restorative materials. Endodontically treated anterior teeth might be
      restored with endocrowns as well as other post-core restorations, however tooth
      fracture failures should be considered that affect reliability of endocrowns.

TI  - Developing meaningful systematic review of CAD/CAM reconstructions and
      fiber-reinforced composites.
PG  - 205-17
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical literature was examined for evidence supporting use of
      CAD/CAM reconstructions and fiber-reinforced materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Potential evidence was identified via databases [PubMed; EMBASE (R) Drugs &
      Pharmacology; Center for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York; Cochrane 
      Library], hand search of non-indexed literature, secondary reference searches,
      and personal contacts with clinical trial PI's. Search terms included: dental
      restorations; CAD/CAM; CEREC; LAVA; CERCON; Procera; inlay/onlay; dental
      prosthesis; fiber-reinforced composite (FRC). RESULTS: Two randomized-controlled 
      clinical trials were identified as examined in one Cochrane Collaboration review 
      relevant to CAD/CAM inlays. One systematic review of 15 CAD/CAM inlay studies was
      examined. Six studies were identified of three commercial FRC endodontic posts
      and eight reported on FRC use for fixed denture prostheses. Fifteen ongoing
      prospective trials were identified studying CAD/CAM fabricated zirconia-based
      prostheses. A total of 76 papers were referenced including those related to use
      of in vitro measures as evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Review of the Cochrane analysis
      raised concerns that typical RCT protocols may prove insufficient for
      stratification of confounding variables (patient, practitioner, material) when
      treatment outcomes are primarily prosthesis- or material-based (not
      patient-based, e.g., as in fracture). RCT designs are most straightforward when
      treatment outcomes are patient-based (e.g., soft tissue changes). When treatment 
      responses are material-based, controls also become difficult to define and
      studies become tests of equivalency/superiority; where well-stratified cohort
      designs are likely preferred. Large numbers of independent cohort studies support
      the use of CAD/CAM ceramic inlay/onlay restorations and crowns but many
      complications inhibit the application of high-level systematic review. Except
      perhaps for fiber-based endodontic posts, the clinical FRC literature appears
      insufficient for expert review. Single in vitro measures cannot currently serve
      as evidence for clinical practice, except in limited cases of simple function
      (e.g., impression material accuracy). Batteries of in vitro measures are often
      applied during materials development but cannot substitute for clinical study.

TI  - The effect of endodontic access preparation on the failure load of lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic restorations.
PG  - 328-36
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(11)60139-X [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Endodontic access preparation through lithium disilicate
      ceramic restorations may damage the restoration and compromise its load-bearing
      capability. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro research was to investigate the
      effect of simulated endodontic access preparation through lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic restorations on their load to failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty 
      lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD) complete-coverage restorations
      were milled and crystallized. Five coats of die relief were applied internally in
      the crown to provide a cement space approximately 60 mum in thickness. Composite 
      resin dies were fabricated by backfilling each crown. The specimens were then
      stored at 37 degrees C and 100% humidity for 30 days. The crowns with their
      respective dies were divided into 6 groups: Groups M-C, M-ZR, M-SC, and M-CRF
      were adhesively bonded with a resin cement (Multilink Implant), and Groups F-C
      and F-ZR were conventionally cemented with zinc phosphate cement (Fleck's). After
      storing all groups for 1 week, Groups M-C and F-C served as the intact controls
      for the 2 cementation techniques, while Groups M-ZR and F-ZR had an access
      prepared with a 126 mum grit-size diamond rotary instrument. For Groups M-SC and 
      M-CRF, the endodontic access was prepared with 150 mum and 180 mum grit-size
      diamond rotary instruments, respectively. Access preparations were restored with 
      composite resin. All specimens were stored at 37 degrees C and 100% humidity for 
      1 week before they were loaded to failure with a universal loading apparatus
      (crosshead speed=1mm/min). The results were analyzed with a 1-way ANOVA followed 
      by Tukey's HSD test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The highest failure loads were achieved
      with Groups M-C (3316 N +/-483) and M-ZR (3464 N +/-645) Larger grit rotary
      instruments resulted in lower failure-loads in Groups M-SC (2915 N +/-569) and
      M-CRF (2354 N +/-476). Groups F-C (2242 N +/-369) and F-ZR(1998 N +/-448) had
      significantly lower failure loads than their adhesively bonded counterparts
      (P<.05). The use of 126 mum grit size did not significantly alter the failure
      loads of the restorations in either cementation technique. CONCLUSIONS:
      Adhesively bonded restorations sustained significantly higher loads to failure
      than those conventionally cemented. The use of a high efficiency, smaller-grit
      diamond rotary instrument for endodontic access preparation did not alter the
      load to failure of lithium disilicate restorations, regardless of the cement
      used. The use of a larger-grit rotary instrument did not improve the cutting
      efficiency and reduced the failure load of bonded restorations.

AB  - Advances in adhesive dentistry and technological developments using dental
      computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems have
      provided alternative esthetic restorations to conventional laboratory processed
      restorations. Restorative materials for CAD/CAM-generated restorations must be
      able to withstand the rigors of the milling process, while providing clinical
      longevity once cemented. The esthetic restorative materials currently available
      for use with the Cerec System provide dentists with ceramic and polymer options
      for inlays, onlays, veneers, and crowns.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The subtractive and additive computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) of lithium disilicate partial coverage
      restorations is poorly documented. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study
      was to compare the marginal and internal fit accuracy of lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic inlays fabricated with conventional, milled, and 3-dimensional (3D)
      printed wax patterns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A dentoform mandibular first molar
      was prepared for a mesio-occlusal ceramic inlay. Five groups of 15 inlays were
      obtained through conventional impression and manual wax pattern (group CICW);
      conventional impression, laboratory scanning of the stone die, CAD-CAM milled wax
      blanks (group CIDW) or 3D printed wax patterns (group CI3DW); and scanning of the
      master preparation with intraoral scanner and CAD-CAM milled (group DSDW) or 3D
      printed wax patterns (group DS3DW). The same design was used to produce the wax
      patterns in the last 4 groups. The replica technique was used to measure marginal
      and internal adaptation by using stereomicroscopy. Mixed-model ANOVA was used to 
      assess differences according to the groups and discrepancy location (alpha=.05). 
      RESULTS: Group DSDW showed the smallest marginal discrepancy (24.3 mum) compared 
      with those of groups CICW (45.1 mum), CIDW (33.7 mum), CI3DW (39.8 mum), and
      DS3DW (39.7 mum) (P<.001). No statistically significant differences were detected
      among groups CICW, CIDW, CI3DW, and DS3DW relative to the marginal discrepancy.
      The internal discrepancy was significantly larger than the marginal discrepancy
      within all groups (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic inlays 
      produced from digital scans and subtractive milling of wax patterns resulted in
      better marginal and internal fit accuracy than either conventional
      impression/fabrication or additive 3D manufacturing. Three-dimensional printed
      wax patterns yielded fit values similar to those of the conventionally waxed
      inlays.

TI  - Three-year clinical comparison of survival of endodontically treated teeth
      restored with either full cast coverage or with direct composite restoration.
PG  - 297-301
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Little information exists regarding the outcome of crown
      build-ups on endodontically treated teeth restored with metal-ceramic crowns or
      with only a direct-placed composite. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the clinical success rate of endodontically treated premolars restored
      with fiber posts and direct composite restorations and compare that treatment
      with a similar treatment of full-coverage with metal-ceramic crowns. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Subjects included in this study had one maxillary or mandibular premolar
      for which endodontic treatment and crown build up was indicated and met specific 
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Only premolars with Class II carious lesions and
      preserved cusp structure were included. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of
      the following 2 experimental groups: (1) teeth endodontically treated and
      restored with adhesive techniques and composite or (2) teeth endodontically
      treated, restored with adhesive techniques and composite, and then restored with 
      full-coverage metal-ceramic crowns. Sixty teeth were included in the first group 
      and 57 in the second. All restorations were performed by one operator. Causes of 
      failure were categorized as root fracture, post fracture, post decementation,
      clinical and/or radiographic evidence of marginal gap between tooth and
      restoration, and clinical and/or radiographic evidence of secondary caries
      contiguous with restoration margins. Subjects were examined for the listed
      clinical and radiographic causes of failure by 2 calibrated examiners at
      intervals of 1, 2, and 3 years. Exact 95% confidence intervals for the difference
      between the 2 experimental groups were calculated. RESULTS: At the 1-year recall,
      no failures were reported. The only failure modes observed at 2 and 3 years were 
      decementations of posts and clinical and/or radiographic evidence of marginal gap
      between tooth and restoration. There was no difference in the failure frequencies
      of the 2 groups (95% confidence interval, -17.5 to 12.6). There was no difference
      between the number of failures caused by post decementations and the presence of 
      marginal gaps observed in the 2 groups (95% confidence intervals, -9.7 to 16.2
      and -17.8 to 9.27). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, the results
      upheld the research hypothesis that the clinical success rates of endodontically 
      treated premolars restored with fiber posts and direct composite restorations
      after 3 years of service were equivalent to a similar treatment of full coverage 
      with metal-ceramic crowns.

TI  - Cerec3D endocrowns--two-year clinical examination of CAD/CAM crowns for restoring
      endodontically treated molars.
PG  - 141-54
AB  - The present clinical study evaluates the clinical prognosis of Cerec3D endocrowns
      over an observation period of two years. Twenty Cerec endocrowns (VITABLOCS Mark 
      II, Vita Zahnfabirk, Bad Sackingen, Germany) were placed with PanaviaTM F 2.0, a 
      dual-curing bonding composite. The control examinations took place semi-annually 
      and the restorations were evaluated based on modified US Public Health Service
      criteria (USPHS). The two-year survival rate of the Cerec endocrowns was 90%. Two
      out of 20 endocrowns were assessed as failure because of fractures. The first
      fracture was observed after 12 months and the second fracture after 18 months. No
      recurrent caries was diagnosed during the entire examination period. Slight
      percussion symptoms were found on three restorations in the first weeks after
      placement. The results of the present study show that good esthetic and
      functional results similar to those of other restoration types can be achieved
      with endocrowns and that CAD/CAM-fabricated crowns represent a very promising
      treatment alternative for endodontically treated molars.

TI  - Effects of post-core design and ferrule on fracture resistance of endodontically 
      treated maxillary central incisors.
PG  - 368-73
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Studies concerning the effects of post-core design and
      ferrule on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth remain
      controversial. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro the
      effects of post-core design and ferrule on the fracture resistance of root canal 
      treated human maxillary central incisors restored with metal ceramic crowns.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight extracted human maxillary central incisors were
      endodontically treated and divided into 4 groups of 12. The following treatments 
      were evaluated: group A: restored with metal ceramic (porcelain fused to metal
      [PFM]) crowns as control; group B: 2-mm ferrule/custom cast post-core/PFM crowns;
      group C: no ferrule/custom cast post-core/PFM crowns; and group D: 2-mm
      ferrule/prefabricated post and resin core/PFM crowns. Each specimen was subjected
      to load (N) on the lingual surface at a 135-degree angle to the long axis with a 
      MTS 810 material testing machine until fracture at a crosshead speed of 0.02
      cm/min. One-way analysis of variance and nonparametric chi-square test were used 
      to compare the results. A significant analysis of variance result was followed by
      Newman-Keuls pairwise multiple comparisons (P<.05). RESULTS: There were
      significant differences among the 4 groups studied (P<.01). Group B had the
      highest fracture strength (1793.59 +/- 387.93 N). There was no significant
      difference among the fracture resistances of the other 3 groups (group A: 958.49 
      +/- 286.02 N; group C: 992.98 +/- 291.00 N; group D: 994.94 +/- 285.04 N).
      CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, not all of the post-core
      structures tested improved the strength of the endodontically treated teeth.
      Those prepared with a 2-mm dentin ferrule more effectively enhanced the fracture 
      strength of custom cast post-core restored endodontically treated maxillary
      central incisors.

      computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) of implant prostheses: A systematic review.
PG  - 289-302
LID - 10.1111/clr.13801 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the dental literature for clinical studies
      reporting on production time, effectiveness and/or costs of additive and
      subtractive computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) of implant prostheses. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: A systematic electronic search for clinical studies from 1990 until 
      June 2020 was performed using the online databases Medline, Embase and Cochrane. 
      Time required for the computer-aided design (CAD) process, the CAM process, and
      the delivery of the CAD-CAM prostheses were extracted. In addition, articles
      reporting on the effectiveness and the costs of both manufacturing technologies
      were included. RESULTS: Nine clinical studies were included reporting on
      subtractive CAM (s-CAM; 8 studies) and additive CAM (a-CAM; 1 study). Eight
      studies reported on the s-CAM of prosthetic and auxiliary components for single
      implant crowns. One study applied a-CAM for the fabrication of an implant bar
      prototype. Time was provided for the CAD process of implant models (range
      4.9-11.8 min), abutments (range 19.7-32.7 min) and crowns (range 11.1-37.6 min). 
      The time for s-CAM of single implant crown components (abutment/crown) ranged
      between 8.2 and 25 min. Post-processing (e.g. sintering) was a time-consuming
      process (up to 530 min). At delivery, monolithic/veneered CAD-CAM implant crowns 
      resulted in additional adjustments chairside (51%/93%) or labside (11%/19%).
      CONCLUSIONS: No scientific evidence exists on production time, effectiveness and 
      costs of digital workflows comparing s-CAM and a-CAM. For both technologies,
      post-processing may substantially contribute to the production time. Considering 
      effectiveness, monolithic CAD-CAM implant crowns may be preferred compared to
      veneered CAD-CAM crowns.

PG  - 276-85
LID - 10.1016/j.jdent.2012.01.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the fracture mode of
      endodontically treated canines (ETC) restored with glass-fibre posts (GFP) and
      either metal-ceramic (MC) or all-ceramic (AC) crowns, in the presence or absence 
      of 2 mm ferrule height. METHODS: Fifty recently extracted human maxillary canines
      were endodontically treated and randomly divided into 5 groups of 10 specimens
      each. Four groups (with or without ferrule) were restored with GFP, composite
      cores and either MC or AC crowns. The fifth group with intact ETC served as
      control. Teeth were loaded to fracture at a 135 degrees angle to their long axis,
      at a cross-head speed 0.5 mm/min. The fracture modes were divided through optical
      microscopy to repairable and irreparable. Statistical analysis was performed by
      means of the Fisher's Exact test. RESULTS: All groups presented brittle fracture 
      following bending deformation. Irreparable root fractures were the primary
      fracture mode independently of ferrule. The percentages (%) of repairable
      fractures were not statistically significant different amongst the MC and AC
      restored teeth independently of ferrule. However the 2 mm ferrule was associated 
      to a higher percentage of repairable fractures, especially in teeth restored with
      AC crowns. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage (%) of repairable fractures was higher in 
      all-ceramic compared to metal-ceramic ETC and in restorations with ferrule,
      although the differences were not statistically significant. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: This in vitro study supports evidence that neither the type of
      crown restoration nor the presence of ferrule affects statistically significantly
      the mode of fracture of ETC restored with GFP.

TI  - Fracture Resistance of Endodontically Treated Maxillary Premolars Restored With
      Different Methods.
PG  - E1-E11
LID - 10.2341/17-262-L [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE:: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the resistance and
      patterns of fracture of endodontically treated maxillary premolars (ETPs)
      restored with different methods. METHODS AND MATERIALS:: Mesio-occluso-distal
      cavities were prepared in 50 extracted caries-free human maxillary premolars
      after endodontic treatment. The teeth were divided into five groups (n=10),
      according to the restorative method. G1: intact teeth (control group); G2:
      conventional composite resin; G3: conventional composite resin with a horizontal 
      glass fiber post inserted between buccal and palatal walls; G4: bulk-fill
      flowable and bulk-fill restorative composites; and G5: ceramic inlay. For direct 
      restorations, Filtek Z350 XT, Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable Restorative, and Filtek
      Bulk Fill Posterior Restorative were used. Indirect restorations were fabricated 
      from a pressable lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e-max Press) and
      adhesively cemented (RelyX Ultimate). All specimens were subjected to
      thermocycling (5 degrees C to 55 degrees C/5000 cycles) and additionally
      submitted to cyclic loading 50,000 times in an Electro-Mechanical Fatigue
      Machine. Next, the specimens were subjected to a compressive load at a crosshead 
      speed of 1 mm/min until fracture. The fractured specimens were analyzed to
      determine the fracture pattern using a stereomicroscope, and then representative 
      specimens were carbon coated to allow for the studying of the fracture surface
      under scanning electron microscopy. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used
      to compare fracture resistance of the groups. The results of fracture patterns
      were submitted to the Fisher exact test (alpha=0.05). RESULTS:: All specimens
      survived fatigue. Mean (standard deviation) failure loads (N) for groups were as 
      follows: G1: 949.6 (331.5); G2: 999.6 (352.5); G3: 934.5 (233.6); G4: 771.0
      (147.4); and G5: 856.7 (237.5). The lowest fracture resistance was recorded for
      G4, and the highest ones were recorded for G2, followed by that of G1 and G3.
      One-way ANOVA did not reveal significant differences between groups ( p>0.05).
      The highest repairable fracture rates were observed in G1 (100%) and G3 (80%).
      CONCLUSIONS:: ETPs restored with conventional composite resin with or without
      horizontal fiber post, bulk-fill composite, and ceramic inlay showed fracture
      resistance similar to that of sound teeth. Conventional composite resin
      restorations exhibited the highest prevalence of unrepairable fractures, and the 
      insertion of a horizontal fiber post decreased this prevalence. Intact teeth
      showed 100% of repairable fractures. It is difficult to extrapolate the results
      directly to a clinical situation due to the limitations of this study.

      blocks.
PG  - 201-10
LID - 10.2341/13-143-L [doi]
AB  - This study assessed marginal leakage and fracture resistance of computer-aided
      design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) fabricated ceramic crowns with
      intracoronal extensions into the pulp chambers of endodontically treated teeth
      (endocrowns) using either feldspathic porcelain (CEREC Blocks [CB], Sirona Dental
      Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany), lithium disilicate (e.max [EX], Ivoclar
      Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), or resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate [LU], 3M
      ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA).). Thirty extracted human permanent maxillary molars were
      endodontically treated. Standardized preparations were done with 2-mm
      intracoronal extensions of the endocrowns into the pulp chamber. Teeth were
      divided into three groups (n=10); each group was restored with standardized
      CAD/CAM fabricated endocrowns using one of the three tested materials. After
      cementation with resin cement, specimens were stored in distilled water at 37
      degrees C for one week, subjected to thermocycling, and immersed in a 5%
      methylene-blue dye solution for 24 hours. A compressive load was applied at 35
      degrees to long axis of the teeth using a universal testing machine until
      failure. Failure load was recorded, and specimens were examined under a
      stereomicroscope for modes of failure and microleakage. Results were analyzed
      using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparison
      tests (alpha=0.05). LU showed significantly (p<0.05) higher fracture resistance
      and more favorable fracture mode (ie, fracture of the endocrown without fracture 
      of tooth) as well as higher dye penetration than CB and EX. In conclusion,
      although using resin nanoceramic blocks for fabrication of endocrowns may result 
      in better fracture resistance and a more favorable fracture mode than other
      investigated ceramic blocks, more microleakage may be expected with this
      material.

TI  - Fracture resistance of prepared premolars restored with bonded new lab composite 
      and all-ceramic inlay/onlay restorations: Laboratory study.
PG  - 229-239
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12364 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of new light curing lab composite,
      lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic and yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based ceramic on
      the fracture resistance of maxillary premolars with class II inlay and onlay
      preparations. METHODS: Seventy sound maxillary premolars were divided randomly
      into seven main groups. The first group was left intact (control group). The
      remaining six groups were prepared with inlay and onlay cavities and restored
      with lab composite (SR Nexco), lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max Press)
      and yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based ceramic (ICE Zirkon). The restorations were
      cemented with luting resin composite (Variolink N). All specimens were
      thermocycled 5000 cycles between 5 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C and 55 degrees C +/-
      2 degrees C and were then cyclic loaded for 500 000 cycles. The specimens were
      subjected to a compressive load in a universal testing machine using a metal
      sphere until fracture occurred. The results were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and
      Tukey HSD post hoc tests. The level of significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: 
      There were no statistically significant differences among the means of control
      group and the groups restored with zirconia ceramic inlays and onlays (P > .05). 
      However, statistically significant differences were found among the means of
      control group and the groups restored with lab composite inlays, lab composite
      onlays, pressable glass ceramic inlays and pressable glass ceramic onlays (P <
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: The fracture resistance of prepared teeth for inlay and onlay 
      restorations is inferior to the intact teeth when lab composite is used.
      Conversely, when a ceramic material being used, the prepared teeth for inlay and 
      onlay restorations showed a comparable strength to the intact teeth especially
      zirconia ceramic. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Premolar teeth restored with zirconia
      ceramic inlays and onlays exhibited fracture resistance comparable to intact
      teeth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of different types of modifications with
      resin on fatigue resistance and failure behavior of CAD-CAM resin nano ceramic
      (RNC) restorations for maxillary first premolars. METHODS: Sixty standardized
      resin composite root dies received CAD-CAM RNC endocrowns (n=30) and crowns
      (n=30) (Lava Ultimate, 3M Espe). Restorations were divided into six groups: full 
      anatomic endocrowns (group A) and crowns (group D), buccal resin veneered
      endocrowns (group B) and crowns (group E) and buccal resin veneered endocrowns
      (group C) and crowns (group F) with a central groove resin filling. A nano-hybrid
      resin composite was used to veneer the restorations (Filtek Supreme, 3M Espe).
      All specimens were first submitted to thermo-mechanical cyclic loading (1.7Hz,
      49N, 600000 cycles, 1500 thermo-cycles) and then submitted to cyclic isometric
      stepwise loading (5Hz) until completion of 105000 cycles or failure after 5000
      cycles at 200N, followed by 20000 cycles at 400N, 600N, 800N, 1000N and 1200N. In
      case of fracture, fragments were analyzed using SEM and modes of failure were
      determined. Results were statistically analyzed by Kaplan-Meier life survival
      analysis and log rank test (p=0.05). RESULTS: The differences in survival between
      groups were not statistically significant, except between groups D and F
      (p=0.039). Endocrowns fractured predominantly with a mesio-distal wedge-opening
      fracture (82%). Partial cusp fractures were observed above all in crowns (70%).
      Analysis of the fractured specimens revealed that the origin of the fracture was 
      mainly at the occlusal contact points of the stepwise loading. SIGNIFICANCE:
      Veneering of CAD-CAM RNC restorations has no influence on their fatigue
      resistance except when monolithic crowns are modified on their occlusal central
      groove.

AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the influence of fatigue loading
      on fracture resistance of endodontically treated molars restored with endocrowns 
      using different machinable blocks. METHODS: Endodontically treated mandibular
      first molars were prepared using a standardized method. Specimens were divided
      into 4 groups (n = 10).Anatomically shaped endocrowns groups were manufactured
      using VITA ENAMIC (VE) and KATANA Zirconia (KZ). Layered endocrowns groups were
      manufactured using IPS e.max CAD (EM) and BioHPP (BH). Half of the specimens of
      each group were subjected to fracture resistance test, while the other half were 
      subjected to thermocycling and chewing simulation. After fatigue loading,
      specimens were loaded until failure. Specimens were examined using
      stereomicroscopy. Data were analyzed using ANOVA analysis of variance and
      Bonferroni post hoc test (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: KZ group had the highest initial 
      fracture resistance value (1810.20+/- 119.56 N) and BH had the lowest value
      (579.50+/- 76.15 N). The reduction of fracture resistance after fatigue loading
      was significant for KZ group (1588.30+/-216.25 N) and BH group (502.60+/-11.53 N)
      and non-significant to VE group (1101.70+/-77.05 N) and EM group (1112.10+/-74.12
      N). Failure modes of KZ and EM groups showed high percentage of non-restorable
      fractures, while VE and BH groups showed high percentage of restorable fractures.
      CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the following can be
      concluded: Poly infiltrated ceramics should be considered as a proper material to
      be used as an endocrown material because of its ability to be restorable if
      failure occurred.

TI  - Assessment of Fracture Resistance Capacity of Different Core Materials with
      Porcelain Fused to Metal Crown: An in vitro Study.
PG  - 389-392
AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the capacity to resist fracture in
      different core buildup materials with porcelain fused to metal (PFM) crown.
      Materials and methods: Totally, 45 mandibular single rooted first premolars were 
      collected, which were sound along with similar shape and size. The teeth were
      sectioned at 15 mm above the root apex sparing the sound tooth structure. The
      teeth were endodontically treated with the crown-down technique using
      nickel-titanium (NiTi) instrumentation. The specimens were randomized into three 
      groups as per the core materials used and were labeled accordingly. Group I
      consisted of dual-cured composite resin, group II consisted of glass ionomer
      reinforced with resin, and group III consisted of Miracle mix. Universal loading 
      machine is used for measuring the compres-sive load applied to fracture the
      tooth. Results: The mean value of compressive strength was maximum in the dual
      cured composite resin (598.42 +/- 22.64) followed by glass ionomer reinforced
      with resin (478.88 +/- 26.74) and Miracle mix (442.16 +/- 30.10). The results
      showed a significant difference statistically within the core materials used with
      p < 0.05. The results from the Tukey's post hoc test of multiple comparisons
      between dual-cured composite resin vs glass ionomer reinforced with resin,
      dual-cured composite resin vs Miracle mix, and glass ionomer reinforced with
      resin vs Miracle mix showed a highly statistical difference with p < 0.05, which 
      is significant. Conclusion: This in vitro study showed that the dual-cured
      composite resin had maximum resistance to fracture compared with other core
      buildup materials on teeth which were endodonti-cally treated. Clinical
      significance: Restoration of a tooth which is structurally compromised is a
      tricky job for all the dentists. Restoring it with a proper core buildup material
      with adequate fracture resistance makes the tooth structure stable. The core
      material should be able to resist all types of occlusal forces and to distribute 
      it equally within the tooth structure. Keywords: Core buildup, Crowns,
      Endodontically treated teeth, Fracture resistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Compare failure modes and fracture origins using fractography on
      recovered clinically fractured parts of indirect resin composite endocrowns and
      overlay restorations on endodontically treated teeth (ETT). METHODS: Four
      endocrowns (3 molars, 1 premolar) and one overlay (molar) adhesively luted on ETT
      were recovered after fracturing during function. The time in service ranged
      between 4 and 48 months. The composite materials were (i) CAD/CAM LAVA Ultimate
      (N = 1), (ii) Premise Indirect (N = 2), and (iii) Colombus (N = 2). Fractography 
      was performed by means of digital microscopy and SEM. Occlusal surfaces were
      checked for signs of fatigue degradation and contact wear. Cuspal plane angles
      were measured from profiles obtained from 3D digital microscope images with
      respect to the horizontal plane of the occlusal central crown groove. RESULTS:
      All five cases showed a wedge-opening mode I fracture, splitting the crown and
      tooth in two parts through the crown's central groove. Classic brittle fracture
      features (arrest lines, twist and wake hackle) were easily identified on the
      fracture surfaces. Multiple origins were located along the central groove in
      conjunction with the presence of fatigue cracks. Contact wear surfaces showed
      pitting and cracking. Cuspal plane angles were around 30-35 degrees , except a 50
      degrees palatal cusp slope for the Lava Ultimate overlay. SIGNIFICANCE:
      Fractography on clinical fractures of resin composites was enlightening. Occlusal
      surface fatigue degradation from cyclic loading, mode I fracture from applied
      mastication forces on cuspal planes, and stress concentration within the crown's 
      central groove, indicate limitations of use of these materials for endocrowns in 
      posterior teeth.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Long-term retrospective evaluation of the survival rate and the
      technical and biologic outcomes of all-ceramic inlays and onlays in premolars and
      molars. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Fifty-four patients treated as part of a
      prospective clinical trial and having received 157 inlays and 27 onlays made out 
      of a leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic (IPS Empress) in premolars and molars, were
      invited to the present follow-up examination. The survival of the restorations
      was evaluated. The biologic outcomes were assessed by measuring the pocket
      probing depth (PPD), the Plaque Index (PI), and the Sulcus Bleeding Index (SBI). 
      The technical behavior was evaluated using modified US Public Health Service
      criteria (modUSPHS). Finally, patient satisfaction was recorded with a
      questionnaire. Data of patients and restored teeth were analyzed descriptively,
      and continuous variables were given in mean values and standard deviations. For
      the analysis of the restoration survival over time, the Kaplan-Meier survival
      estimate was calculated. The level of statistical significance was set at P <
      .05. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (20 women, 16 men; mean age 50.9 years) with
      132 restorations, 107 inlays and 25 onlays, were examined after a mean
      observation time of 11.2 +/- 4.3 years. The overall 11-year survival rate of the 
      132 restorations was 80.3%. Inlays exhibited an 11-year survival rate of 80.4%
      and onlays of 80.0%. Twenty-two technical complications occurred. Ceramic
      fractures (10.6%) and chipping (2.3%) were the most frequent complications. Six
      biologic complications occurred (4.5%). CONCLUSION: Glass-ceramic inlays and
      onlays presented favorable long-term clinical survival and success rates.
      Technical complications were predominant, and biologic problems remained rare.
      More clinical long-term data are needed.

TI  - Prosthodontic Complications of Metal-Ceramic and All-Ceramic, Complete-Arch Fixed
      Implant Prostheses with Minimum 5 Years Mean Follow-Up Period. A Systematic
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e722-e735
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12797 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to review
      and analyze the prosthodontic complications, survival, and success of
      metal-ceramic (MC) and all-ceramic (AC) complete-arch fixed implant dental
      prostheses (CFIDPs) with a minimum mean follow-up period of 5 years. METHODS: A
      structured literature search was conducted using 3 electronic databases (MEDLINE,
      the Cochrane Library, Web of Science) for clinical studies reporting on
      prosthodontic complications of metal-ceramic and/or all-ceramic CFIDPs published 
      between 2000 and 2016. This was complemented with hand searching in relevant
      journals, references, as well as searching in grey literature. Risk of bias
      analysis for randomized controlled trials was done following the recommendations 
      from the Cochrane Collaboration. Quality appraisal for nonrandomized studies was 
      executed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). The final selection
      included only studies with a minimum mean follow-up time of 5 years. RESULTS: The
      electronic databases search yielded 1804 relevant titles and abstracts; 11
      studies were finally selected (9 for MC and 2 for AC CFIDPs). Risk of bias in
      most selected studies was low. Heterogeneity across studies of MC CFIDPs was
      within acceptable range but not among AC CFIDP studies, so no meta-analysis was
      performed for the latter. Regarding MC CFIDPs, most studies recorded 100%
      survival rate (survival range: 92.4-100%, success range: 47-96.7%), with veneer
      fracture being the most-common complication. Five- and 10-year cumulative
      complication rates for MC CFIDP veneer fractures were 22.1% and 39.3%,
      respectively, but with variable confidence intervals. The 2 studies included for 
      AC CFIDPs reported 100% survival rates but differed in success rates, with the
      one using predominantly monolithic zirconia restorations reporting 90.9%, and the
      one using bi-layered zirconia reporting 60.4%, with complications attributed to
      veneer fracture. CONCLUSIONS: MC and AC CFIDPs presented with veneer fractures as
      primary complication. This may require significant maintenance. Other
      complications were negligible after a mean follow-up period of at least 5 years. 
      More long-term studies, especially on all-ceramic CFIDPs are needed.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Indirect restorations with partial or complete occlusal
      surface coverage have been recommended to restore teeth with weakened walls in
      order to prevent cusp fracture. The success of these restorations when performed 
      by dental students is unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study
      was to evaluate the clinical performance of adhesively bonded ceramic onlay
      restorations placed by third- and fourth-year dental students. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Sixty-five ceramic onlays were placed in patients between 2009 and 2015.
      The onlays were laboratory or chairside fabricated with a computer-aided design
      and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) system, using either IPS e.max Press
      or IPS e.max CAD. An adhesive technique and luting composite resin agent were
      used to cement the restorations. Thirty-seven onlays were evaluated clinically
      using the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Data
      were statistically analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model to compare
      tooth type and failures and the Fisher exact and McNemar tests to compare the
      USPHS criteria for significant differences (alpha=.05). Survival probability was 
      calculated using the Kaplan-Meier algorithm. RESULTS: Five onlays were considered
      to be failures and needed replacement. According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis,
      the estimated survival rate was 96.3% after 2 years and 91.5% at 4 years. All 5
      of the failures occurred on molars (13.5%) and none on premolars (P=.025). A
      statistically significant difference was found for marginal discoloration between
      onlays placed within 0 to 3 years and 3 to 6 years (P<.05) but no differences
      between any other criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Ceramic onlays placed by dental students
      demonstrated acceptable long-term clinical performance.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the restorative
      material for implant-supported prostheses. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate studies that compared ceramic
      and metal-ceramic restorations for implant-supported prostheses (within the same 
      study to avoid indirect comparison) in terms of the mechanical and biological
      complication rates, prosthesis survival rate, and marginal bone loss. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: Two independent reviewers performed a comprehensive search in
      databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) for articles
      indexed until March 31, 2018. The search was performed in accordance with the
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
      statement and methods were registered in the International Prospective Register
      of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). The focused question was ""Do ceramic
      restorations have mechanical/biological complication rates, prosthesis survival
      rates, and marginal bone loss similar to those of metal-ceramic restorations?""
      RESULTS: The search identified 949 references. The interinvestigator agreement
      using kappa values was 0.87 for PubMed/MEDLINE, 0.93 for Scopus, and 1.0 for the 
      Cochrane Library. After analysis, 12 studies were selected for qualitative and
      quantitative analysis. The mechanical complication rate did not differ between
      ceramic and metal-ceramic restorations (P=.89), independent of the type of
      prostheses (single crown: P=.63; fixed partial denture: P=.65). The biological
      complication rate was also not significantly different between ceramic and
      metal-ceramic restorations (P=.21). The prosthesis survival rate showed no
      significant differences between the 2 types of restorations (P=.56). Marginal
      bone loss was also similar for both types of restorations (P=.12). CONCLUSIONS:
      This systematic review indicated that ceramic and metal-ceramic implant-supported
      prostheses have similar mechanical and biological complication rates, prosthesis 
      survival rates, and marginal bone loss. Thus, both treatments are appropriate
      options for long-term rehabilitation treatment.

      full-coverage molar restorations. Influence of ceramic material and preparation
      design.
PG  - 533-8
LID - 10.1016/j.dental.2010.01.011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of preparation
      design, and ceramic material, masticatory fatigue and fracture resistance of
      non-retentive all-ceramic full-coverage restorations luted on human mandibular
      molars. METHODS: Full-coverage occlusal restorations were laboratory fabricated
      from leucite reinforced glass-ceramic (IPS Empress Esthetic) or lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max Press). For each ceramic material four groups
      with eight specimens each were randomly assigned. Groups had either a
      non-retentive, occlusal preparation with chamfer finishing line or
      straight-beveled finishing line and the preparation was either completely within 
      enamel or within dentin with a finishing line in enamel. Restorations were
      adhesively luted to the teeth using composite resin. After storage in water for 1
      week specimens were cyclic loaded 600,000 times with a weight of 10kg and
      additionally, thermocycled 3500 times (5/55 degrees C) in a masticatory
      simulator. Surviving specimens were loaded until, fracture in a universal testing
      machine. Statistical analysis was done using three-way ANOVA. RESULTS: All
      specimens survived the masticatory fatigue. Mean fracture resistance ranged from 
      2895 to 4173N. Influence of ceramic material on fracture resistance was
      significant (p=0.0001). Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations had higher 
      fracture resistances than leucite reinforced glass-ceramic restorations.
      Different preparation designs showed no significant influence on fracture
      resistance (p=0.0969). The design of the finishing line did not influence the
      fracture resistance (p=0.9461). SIGNIFICANCE: The fracture resistance of
      adhesively luted non-retentive full-coverage molar restorations, made of lithium 
      disilicate or leucite reinforced glass-ceramic is promising and seems to permit
      clinical application.

TI  - Fracture resistance and failure patterns of endodontically treated mandibular
      molars with and without glass fiber post in combination with a zirconia-ceramic
      crown.
PG  - 513-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jdent.2008.03.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a fiber post
      on the fracture mechanics of zirconia crowns inserted over endodontically treated
      teeth with different extent of coronal damage. METHODS: Endodontically treated
      human molars with three types of coronal damage received fiber posts before
      cementation of zirconia-veneered crowns. Controls received composite resin cores 
      without fiber posts. The specimens were loaded to failure and fractographically
      examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS: Statistical
      analysis revealed that specimens with fiber posts demonstrated significantly
      higher failure loads and favorable fracture pattern compared to the controls. At 
      fractographic analysis, specimens with fiber posts demonstrated delamination of
      the veneer ceramic from intact zirconia under structure. Meanwhile, the specimens
      that were restored without a fiber post demonstrated micro-cracking of the
      composite core build-up resulting in loss of the support under the zirconia
      crowns which was responsible for the initiation of radial crack and catastrophic 
      damage. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitation of this study, the insertion of fiber 
      post improved the support under zirconia crowns which resulted in higher fracture
      loads and favorable failure type compared to composite core build-up.

TI  - Longevity of ceramic onlays: A systematic review.
PG  - 193-215
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12384 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the longevity of ceramic
      onlays and identify the factors that influence their survival. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: An electronic search was conducted through PubMed (MEDLINE), Google
      Scholar and Cochrane Library, up to August 2017. The literature search aimed to
      retrieve all the clinical studies on the longevity of ceramic onlays. Ceramic
      onlay was defined as any partial ceramic restoration that covers at least one
      cusp. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies met the selection criteria and were deemed
      suitable for this review. The medium-term studies (2-5 years) indicated a
      survival rate of 91-100%, and the long term studies (more than 5 years) showed a 
      survival rate of 71-98.5%. The most common reason of failure was fracture,
      followed by debonding and caries. The most common patterns of deterioration were 
      loss of margin integrity and discoloration. Onlay longevity can be enhanced if
      the preparation allows for at least 2 mm occlusal ceramic thickness and
      incorporates additional retentive features. Restoring teeth that are nonvital,
      teeth in a more posterior region, or teeth for patients with parafunctional
      habits appears to be associated with greater ceramic failure. Fabrication
      materials and methods, and adhesive bonding system did not seem to influence
      onlay longevity. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical performance of the ceramic onlay
      appears acceptable regardless of the follow-up duration. Fracture of the ceramic 
      onlay is the predominant cause of failure, and the most observed form of
      deterioration was associated with the restoration margin. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Ceramic onlay appears to be a reliable option to restore posterior teeth. The
      most common pattern of failure is fracture of the ceramic material. The risk of
      ceramic onlay failure seems to increase if the restored tooth is nonvital and the
      patient demonstrates parafunctional habits.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The preparation design and fabrication materials directly
      affect the clinical success of endocrown restorations, and yet, knowledge is
      lacking about the biomechanical impact of specific designs or materials on
      endocrown restorations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro and finite element 
      analysis study was to evaluate the biomechanical behavior of endocrown
      restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 36 freshly extracted mandibular
      first molars were collected. The teeth were prepared as per 2 different
      preparation geometries: with the buccal wall intact (Class 2) and without the
      buccal wall (Class 3). Teeth were restored with endocrowns made from 3 different 
      fabricating materials, Vita Enamic, GC Cerasmart, and Lava Ultimate. To analyze
      the in vitro fracture strength, cemented endocrowns were loaded in a universal
      test machine with a 200-N oblique force until the restoration fractured. Finite
      element analysis was used to evaluate the stress distribution on both the dentin 
      tissue and the restorative materials. The data were analyzed with a 2-way ANOVA
      test and the Tukey post hoc test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: No significant differences
      were found between the different preparation designs (Class 2 and Class 3) on
      fracture strength (P>.05). The highest mean +/-standard deviation fracture
      strength values were found in the Lava Ultimate material (Class 2, 606.20 +/-293;
      Class 3, 659.40 +/-226 N) (P>.05), but the lowest fracture strength test values
      were obtained in the Vita Enamic material (Class 2, 439.60 +/-136; Class 3, 340
      +/-98 N) (P>.05) for both preparation design test groups. CONCLUSIONS: A
      statistically significant difference was not found between the 2 tooth
      preparation classifications. However, significant differences were observed among
      the test groups in the Class 2 preparation specimens. The Class 2 preparation
      design exhibited a higher number of irreparable failures.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Evidence relating to the choice of materials for single
      implant-supported crowns is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic
      review and meta-analysis was to assess articles that compared the clinical
      performance of ceramic and metal-ceramic (MC) implant-supported single crowns
      with regard to prosthesis failure, complication rate, and patient satisfaction.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of databases (PubMed/MEDLINE,
      Scopus, and Cochrane Library) was performed. The last search was conducted in
      December 2019. Randomized clinical trials comparing ceramic and MC
      implant-supported single crowns with at least a 12-month follow-up were included,
      all of which were published in English. The pooled effects were presented as both
      a risk difference (RD) and mean difference according to the type of data with 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Seven randomized clinical trials fulfilled
      the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled data 
      did not show any statistically significant differences concerning prosthesis
      failure (RD: 0.000, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.06), marginal bone loss (mean difference
      [MD]: -0.02, 95% CI: -0.75 to 0.35), mechanical complications (RD: -0.06, 95% CI:
      -0.18 to 0.07), biological complications (RD: 0.02, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.11), or
      patient satisfaction (MD: 4.86, 95% CI: -2.86 to 12.58). CONCLUSIONS: Ceramic and
      MC crowns had similar outcomes with regard to prosthesis failure, mechanical and 
      biological complication rates, and patient satisfaction. As a result, the
      selection of single implant crown material depends on the preference of the
      dentist and patient.

TI  - A comparison of the fracture resistance of premolars without a ferrule with
      different post systems.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Which type of post improves the performance of
      endodontically treated mandibular premolars without a ferrule remains unclear.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the restoration of
      endodontically treated mandibular premolars without a ferrule by using different 
      post systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty extracted mandibular premolars were
      endodontically treated, and their crowns removed. They were divided into 3 groups
      with different post systems (n=10): zirconia ceramic posts (ZRPs), fiber posts
      (FPs), and bundled glass fiber-reinforced composite resin posts (GTPs). After
      post placement and core fabrication, computer-aided design and computer-aided
      manufacture (CAD-CAM) lithium disilicate crowns were cemented. The specimens were
      subjected to thermocycling and mastication simulation before a fracture test in a
      universal testing machine. The maximum load at which the fracture occurred was
      recorded, and the fractured specimens were examined by using an optical
      microscope. The data were analyzed for statistical differences with a 1-way ANOVA
      and the Tukey honestly significant difference post hoc test (alpha=.05). RESULTS:
      No statistically significant difference in fracture strength was found among the 
      groups (P=.970). From the light microscopy examination, catastrophic failure was 
      observed in all specimens, and there was no failure of the ceramic crowns.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this in vitro study, the choice of post
      material with a low or high modulus of elasticity did not prevent catastrophic
      failures in endodontically treated teeth without a ferrule.

TI  - Fit Accuracy of Pressed and Milled Lithium Disilicate Inlays Fabricated From
      Conventional Impressions or a Laboratory-Based Digital Workflow.
PG  - 18-25
LID - 10.1922/EJPRD_01828Homsy08 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The impact of material on the adaptation of lithium disilicate inlays is
      poorly documented. This in vitro study aims at comparing the fit accuracy of
      pressed and milled inlays obtained from conventional impression and
      laboratory-based computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: A typodont molar was prepared for a mesio-occlusal ceramic inlay.
      The stone die generated from one conventional impression was scanned once using a
      laboratory scanner and the same design was used to produce 15 pressed lithium
      disilicate inlays from milled wax patterns (group CIDW), and 15 inlays from
      lithium disilicate blanks (group CICAD) with a 5-axis milling machine. Marginal
      and internal discrepancies were measured using the replica technique. Mixed-model
      ANOVA was applied to assess differences according to material and gap location at
      P0.05. RESULTS: Material and discrepancy location had a significant effect on fit
      measurements. Group CIDW showed significantly smaller marginal (37.4 mum) and
      internal (69.2 mum) discrepancies than group CICAD (59.6 mum and 93.7 mum
      respectively). Marginal discrepancies were significantly smaller than internal
      discrepancies within both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Pressed inlays generated from
      conventional impression and milled wax patterns yielded better fit accuracy than 
      milled inlays obtained from conventional impression and subtractive
      manufacturing.

TI  - Wear in Antagonist Teeth Produced by Monolithic Zirconia Crowns: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - E997 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9040997 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine 
      the wear sustained in the natural antagonist tooth in cases of full-coverage
      fixed-base prosthetic restorations or monolithic zirconia tooth-supported crowns,
      as well as to determine the wear in the restoration itself, both in the short-
      and medium-term and considering the factors that may influence wear. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis, based on Preferred
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
      recommendations, of clinical studies that evaluated wear in antagonist teeth in
      relation to fixed-prosthesis monolithic zirconia crowns. A total of 5 databases
      were consulted in the literature search: Pubmed-Medline, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase
      and Web of Science (WOS). After eliminating duplicated articles and applying the 
      inclusion criteria, eight articles were selected for the qualitative analysis and
      four for the quantitative analysis. RESULTS: Mean maximum wear of the antagonist 
      tooth in relation to monolithic zirconia crowns of magnitude 95.45 microm (CI at 
      95% 79.57-111.33) was observed. By using a meta-regression model (R(2) = 0.92)
      the significant effect of time in maximum wear rate (p < 0.001) was observed,
      estimated at 6.13 microm per month (CI at 95% 3.99-8.27). Furthermore, monolithic
      zirconia crowns are subject to a mean maximum wear of 58.47 microm (CI 95%
      45.44-71.50). By using a meta-regression model (R(2) = 0.53) the significant
      effect of time in the maximum wear value was observed (p = 0.053), estimated at
      3.40 microm per month (CI al 95% -0.05-6.85). CONCLUSIONS: Monolithic zirconia
      crowns lead to a progressive maximum wear of the antagonist tooth over time which
      is greater than the maximum wear sustained in the crown itself. It is not
      possible to establish an objective and quantitative objection in relation to
      natural enamel wear or metal-ceramic crowns.

TI  - Endocrown restorations: Influence of dental remnant and restorative material on
      stress distribution.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the stress distribution in a
      tooth/restoration system according to the factors ""amount of dental remnant"" (3
      levels) and ""restorative material"" (2 levels). METHODS: Three endodontically
      treated maxillary molars were modeled with CAD software for conducting non-linear
      finite element analysis (FEA), each with a determined amount of dental remnant of
      1.5, 3, or 4.5mm. Models were duplicated, and half received restorations in
      lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD), while the other half received leucite ceramic
      restorations (IPS Empress CAD), both from Ivoclar Vivadent (Schaan,
      Liechtenstein). The solids were imported to analysis software (ANSYS 17.2, ANSYS 
      Inc., Houston, TX, USA) in STEP format. All contacts involving the resin cement
      were considered no-separation, whereas between teeth and fixation cylinder, the
      contact was considered perfectly bonded. The mechanical properties of each
      structure were reported, and the materials were considered isotropic, linearly
      elastic, and homogeneous. An axial load (300N) was applied at the occlusal
      surface (triploidism area). Results were determined by colorimetric graphs of
      maximum principal stress (MPS) on tooth remnant, cement line, and restoration.
      RESULTS: MPS revealed that both factors influenced the stress distribution for
      all structures; the higher the material's elastic modulus, the higher the stress 
      concentration on the restoration and the lower the stress concentration on the
      cement line. Moreover, the greater the dental crown remnant, the higher the
      stress concentration on the restoration. Thus, the remaining dental tissue should
      always be preserved. SIGNIFICANCE: In situations in which few dental remnants are
      available, the thicker the restoration, the higher the concentration of stresses 
      in its structure, protecting the adhesive interface from potential adhesive
      failures. Results are more promising when the endocrown is fabricated with
      lithium disilicate ceramic.

TI  - Marginal adaptation of CAD-CAM and heat-pressed lithium disilicate crowns: A
      systematic review and meta-analysis.

LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.03.021 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Lithium disilicate crowns can be manufactured by
      computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) or with the
      heat-pressed technique. The outcome of studies comparing the effect of the
      manufacturing method on the marginal adaptation of these crowns is not clear.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to
      investigate the effect of the CAD-CAM system and pressing technique on the
      marginal adaptation of lithium disilicate crowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This
      study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A literature research was conducted in MEDLINE 
      via PubMed and Scopus databases, relevant journal sites, and the authors'
      collected references, from January 2009 to April 2019. RESULTS: The electronic
      and manual searches that could be read in full totaled 24 studies; of which, 9
      were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, 7 of which were in
      vitro and 2 in vivo. Statistical analyses were conducted by using Review Manager 
      software program. Meta-analyses were performed with the random effects model
      (alpha=.05). In vitro studies showed no difference in the manufacturing (P>.001; 
      95% confidence interval -0.687 to 0.632), and no significant difference was found
      for in vivo studies (P=.7, 95% confidence interval 0.00 to 54.77). In the joint
      analysis of the in vivo and in vitro articles, there was a significant difference
      between the manufacturing methods (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Differences were
      detected between the marginal adaptation of lithium disilicate crowns fabricated 
      with the CAD-CAM system and the pressing technique, but the accuracy values were 
      clinically acceptable.

TI  - Influence of type of luting cement used with all-ceramic crowns on load
      capability of post-restored endodontically treated maxillary central incisors.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - Adhesive luting of the final restorations is supposed to support the overall
      strength of post-endodontically restored teeth. For evaluating adhesive vs
      conventional cementation, the load capability of adhesively restored
      endodontically treated teeth (ETT) with glass fibre-reinforced composite posts
      (GFRCP), resin composite cores and all-ceramic crowns was determined. Thirty-two 
      caries-free human upper, central incisors were randomly assigned to four groups, 
      endodontically treated and cut 2 mm above the cemento-enamel junction. All teeth 
      were restored with GFRCP, composite core build-ups and all-ceramic crowns.
      All-ceramic crowns were cemented with zinc phosphate cement (I), glass ionomer
      cement (II), and a self-adhesive resin cement (III and IV). After
      thermo-mechanical loading, the specimens were loaded to fracture. Maximum load
      capability F(max) and fracture patterns were compared using non-parametric
      statistics. Median values for the maximum load capability F(max)
      (minimum/maximum) in [N] were: I = 503 (416/1,038), II = 442 (369/711), III = 502
      (326/561) and IV = 518 (416/652). No statistically significant differences were
      found for F(max) (p = 0.761) and fracture patterns (p = 0.094) between the
      experimental groups. The type of cementation of all-ceramic crowns, whether
      self-adhesive or conventional, appears to have no impact on the load capability
      of ETT restored with GFRCP and composite core build-ups.

TI  - Efficacy of composite versus ceramic inlays and onlays: study protocol for the
      CECOIA randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 278
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-14-278 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental caries is a common disease and affects many adults worldwide. 
      Inlay or onlay restoration is widely used to treat the resulting tooth substance 
      loss. Two esthetic materials can be used to manufacture an inlay/onlay
      restoration of the tooth: ceramic or composite. Here, we present the protocol of 
      a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the clinical efficacy
      of both materials for tooth restoration. Other objectives are analysis of overall
      quality, wear, restoration survival and prognosis. METHODS: The CEramic and
      COmposite Inlays Assessment (CECOIA) trial is an open-label, parallel-group,
      multicenter RCT involving two hospitals and five private practices. In all, 400
      patients will be included. Inclusion criteria are adults who need an inlay/onlay 
      restoration for one tooth (that can be isolated with use of a dental dam and has 
      at least one intact cusp), can tolerate restorative procedures and do not have
      severe bruxism, periodontal or carious disease or poor oral hygiene. The decayed 
      tissue will be evicted, the cavity will be prepared for receiving an inlay/onlay 
      and the patient will be randomized by use of a centralized web-based interface to
      receive: 1) a ceramic or 2) composite inlay or onlay. Treatment allocation will
      be balanced (1:1). The inlay/onlay will be adhesively luted. Follow-up will be
      for 2 years and may be extended; two independent examiners will perform the
      evaluations. The primary outcome measure will be the score obtained with use of
      the consensus instrument of the Federation Dentaire Internationale (FDI) World
      Dental Federation. Secondary outcomes include this instrument's items,
      inlay/onlay wear, overall quality and survival of the inlay/onlay. Data will be
      analyzed by a statistician blinded to treatments and an adjusted ordinal logistic
      regression model will be used to compare the efficacy of both materials.
      DISCUSSION: For clinicians, the CECOIA trial results may help with evidence-based
      recommendations concerning the choice of materials for inlay/onlay restoration.
      For patients, the results may lead to improvement in long-term restoration. For
      researchers, the results may provide ideas for further research concerning
      inlay/onlay materials and prognosis.This trial is funded by a grant from the
      French Ministry of Health. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

TI  - A comparison of mvM stress of inlays, onlays and endocrowns made from various
      materials and their bonding with molars in a computer simulation of mastication -
      FEA.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to compare the mvM stresses occurring in
      inlays, onlays and endocrowns made from different materials and their bonding
      with molars in a computer simulation of mastication. METHODS: The study was
      conducted using the finite elements method with contact elements. Sixteen 3D
      first molar models were created of a intact tooth - T; a tooth with a ceramic
      inlay - IN; a tooth with an onlay - ON; and a tooth with an endocrown - EN. The
      restorations were made of: Comp - resin nanoceramic; Hc - hybrid ceramic; Le -
      leucite ceramic; Dlit - lithium disilicate; and Zr - zirconia. Computer
      simulations of mastication were performed. The equivalent stresses according to
      the modified von Mises criterion (mvM) were calculated in model materials and
      contact stresses at the interface cement-dental tissue around the examined
      restorations. RESULTS: The highest equivalent mvM stresses were concentrated in
      buccal margins of inlays. The mvM stresses recorded in onlays were 1.6-5 times
      lower than those found in inlays, while in endocrowns they were 2.3-6.5 times
      lower. Around the onlays and endocrowns, in tooth structures and luting cement,
      mvM stresses were significantly lower compared to teeth restored with inlays. The
      tensile and shear contact stresses between inlays and teeth were several times
      lower than under another restorations. The highest stresses (58.5MPa) occurred in
      the zirconia inlay. The stresses observed in the enamel of a tooth restored with 
      an INZr inlay were half those noted in INComp, and a third of those observed in
      cement. Tensile contact stresses at the interface between the INZr inlay and
      dental tissue were 4.5 times lower than in the INComp, and the shear stresses
      were more than 7 times lower. SIGNIFICANCE: The highest values and unfavorable of
      stress levels occurred in teeth restored with inlays. Cavities MOD in molars
      should be reconstructed with cusp-covering restorations. The endocrown in molars 
      should withstand physiological loading. The higher the modulus of elasticity of
      the restoration material, the higher the stresses in the restorations, while the 
      lower stresses were observed in the tooth structures, luting cement and at the
      interface between the restoration and the dental tissue. Ceramic restorations
      should provide better protection and marginal seal of the reconstructed tooth
      than composite ones.

TI  - Mechanical stability and technical outcomes of monolithic CAD/CAM fabricated
      abutment-crowns supported by titanium bases: An in vitro study.
PG  - 222-232
LID - 10.1111/clr.13693 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate mechanical stability (survival and complication rates)
      and bending moments of different all-ceramic monolithic restorations bonded to
      titanium bases (hybrid abutment-crowns) or to customized titanium abutments
      compared to porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns (PFM) after thermo-mechanical aging. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty conical connection implants (4.3 mm-diameter) were
      divided in five groups (n = 12): PFM using gold abutment (GAbut-PFM), lithium
      disilicate crown bonded to customized titanium abutment (TAbut+LDS), lithium
      disilicate abutment-crown bonded to titanium base (TiBase+LDS), zirconia
      abutment-crown bonded to titanium base (TiBase+ZR), polymer-infiltrated
      ceramic-network (PICN) abutment-crown bonded to titanium base (TiBase+PICN).
      Simultaneous thermocycling (5 degrees -55 degrees C) and chewing simulation
      (1,200,000-cycles, 49 N, 1.67 Hz) were applied. Catastrophic and non-catastrophic
      events were evaluated under light microscope, and survival and complication rates
      were calculated. Specimens that survived aging were loaded until failure and
      bending moments were calculated. RESULTS: Survival rates after aging were 100%
      (TAbut+LDS, TiBase+LDS), 91.7% (GA-PFM), 66.7% (TiBase+ZR) and 58.3%
      (TiBase+PICN) and differed among the groups (p = .006). Non-catastrophic events
      as screw loosening (GA-PFM) and loss of retention or micro-/macro-movement
      (TiBase groups) were observed. Complication rates varied among the groups (p <
      .001). TiBase+PICN had lower bending moment than all the other groups (p < .001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid abutment-crowns made of lithium disilicate can be an
      alternative to PFM-based restorations, although concerns regarding the bonded
      interface between the titanium base and abutment-crown can be raised. PICN and
      zirconia may not be recommended due to its inferior mechanical and bonding
      outcomes, respectively. Titanium customized abutment with bonded lithium
      disilicate crown appears to be the most stable combination.

      Feather-Edge Margins Cemented on 105 Patients.
PG  - 54-63

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical performance of lithium disilicate (LiDiSi)
      computer-aided- design/computer-assisted-manufacturing (CAD/CAM) veneers with
      feather-edge margins. METHODS: Over 4 years (2015-2019), 1075 LiDiSi veneers with
      feather-edge margins were fabricated with a fully digital workflow and cemented
      on 105 patients. The outcome variables were survival of the restorations, colour 
      matching, quality of the ceramic surface, presence of marginal discolouration and
      marginal integrity. The last four variables were assessed using the modified
      California Dental Association (CDA) and Ryge criteria. RESULTS: The mean
      observation period was 30.8 months. The cumulative survival rate was 99.83%. At
      the last follow-up control, the colour matching of the surviving 1074
      restorations was rated Alpha (1064 veneers, 99.06%) and Bravo (10 veneers,
      0.94%); the ceramic surface was rated Alpha (1070 veneers, 99.62%) and Bravo (4
      veneers, 0.38%); the marginal discolouration was rated Alpha (1069 veneers,
      99.53%) and Bravo (5 veneers, 0.47%); and the marginal integrity was rated Alpha 
      (1070 veneers, 99.62%) and Bravo (4 veneers, 0.38%). CONCLUSION: CAD/CAM LiDiSi
      veneers with feather-edge margins fabricated with a fully digital workflow showed
      good clinical performance in terms of survival, colour matching, ceramic surface,
      marginal discolouration and integrity. Further, prospective and long-term studies
      are needed to confirm these positive results.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term clinical performance of direct versus
      indirect composite inlays/onlays in posterior teeth. DATA: Screening for
      inclusion eligibility, quality assessment of studies and data extraction was
      performed independently by two authors. SOURCES: The electronic databases
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register and CENTRAL were
      searched (14.12.2015), with no restriction to publication date or language. We
      included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and evaluated them according to
      Cochrane risk of bias tool. The main outcome assessed was the restoration
      failure, determined by several clinical parameters. STUDY SELECTION: Two studies 
      concerning direct and indirect inlays (82 patients with 248 restorations) and one
      study for onlays (157 patients with 176 restorations) satisfied the inclusion
      criteria. Two trials, one of unclear and one of high risk of bias, could be
      mathematically combined. The meta-analysis indicated no statistically significant
      difference in the risk failure between direct and indirect inlays, after 5 years 
      (RR: 1.54; 95% Cl: 0.42, 5.58; p=0.52) or 11 years of function (RR: 0.95; 95% Cl:
      0.34, 2.63; p=0.92). Only one parameter, the marginal discoloration, slightly
      favored direct inlays after 11 years (RR: 0.41; 95% Cl: 0.17, 0.96; p=0.04). Only
      one study dealt with onlays; an overall 5-year survival of 87% (95% CI: 81-93%)
      was reported. CONCLUSION: The difference of the two techniques did not reach
      statistical significance in order to recommend one technique over the other. The 
      scarcity of primary studies support the need for further well-designed long-term 
      studies in order to reach firm conclusions about both techniques. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: Resin composite materials, placed directly or indirectly, exhibit a
      promising long-term clinical performance when rehabilitation of posterior teeth
      is needed. Although many years in clinical practice, the selection of the best
      treatment protocol still remains subjective. The available studies, and their
      synthesis, cannot provide reliable evidence in this field.

TI  - Survival Rates from Fracture of Endodontically Treated Premolars Restored with
      Full-coverage Crowns or Direct Resin Composite Restorations: A Retrospective
      Study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to compare the survival rates
      against fracture of premolar endodontically treated teeth (ETT) restored with
      resin composite or crowns and to identify risk factors associated with the
      fracture. METHODS: Data from dental records and radiographs of premolar ETT with 
      postendodontic restorations (ie, resin composite or crowns) were collected
      between 2012 and 2016 and selected following selected inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Tooth location, type of restoration, number of proximal contacts, and
      amount of tooth surface loss were recorded. The incidence and restorability of
      postendodontic fractures were identified. Survival rates against fracture of the 
      2 restoration types were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Any
      potential factors associated with fractures were identified using Cox
      proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The survival rate against fracture of ETT
      restored with crowns (95.1%) was higher than resin composite (77.0%). ETT
      restored with resin composite with 1 or 2 tooth surface losses and 2 proximal
      contacts had a high survival rate of 88.5% that was not significantly different
      from ETT with crowns. A higher incidence of restorability after fracture was
      observed in teeth restored with resin composite than crowns. The type of
      restoration and number of proximal contacts were identified as potential risk
      factors associated with fracture incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The survival rate
      against fracture of ETT restored with crowns was higher than resin composite.
      However, ETT with 1 or 2 tooth surface losses and 2 proximal contacts and
      restored with resin composite showed a high survival rate that was comparable
      with ETT restored with crowns.

      as compared to tooth-supported restorations?
PG  - 71-95
AB  - PURPOSE: The study provides a systematic review of the literature to determine
      the long-term survival characteristics of single implant-supported crowns and
      fixed partial dentures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE,
      and Cochrane Collaboration databases was conducted to identify articles that
      compared survival and success of fixed partial dentures and single
      implant-supported crowns. In addition to comparative cohort studies, articles
      that pertained specifically to single implant-supported crowns or fixed partial
      dentures were included in this review. Inclusion criteria for implant and fixed
      partial denture articles included a minimum 2-year study, primary publication in 
      the English language, a minimum of 12 implants, implants designed to
      osseointegrate, and inclusion of data regarding implant and prosthetic
      performance. Data were analyzed using cumulative proportions of survival and
      success for both prosthetic types and for individual implants. Wilson score
      method was used to establish 95% confidence intervals for each population. The
      chi-square test for homogeneity was performed. RESULTS: The literature search
      failed to identify any articles that directly compared survival or success of
      single implant-supported restorations with fixed partial dentures. Following the 
      search criteria, and independent analysis by reviewers, 51 articles were
      identified in the implant literature (agreement, 95.42%; kappa coefficient,
      0.8976), and 41 were identified in the fixed partial denture literature
      (agreement, 90.97%; kappa coefficient, 0.7524). Pooled success of single-implant 
      restorations at 60 months was 95.1% (CI: 92.2%-98.0%), while fixed partial
      dentures of all designs exhibited an 84.0% success rate (CI: 79.1%-88.9%).
      CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review of the scientific literature failed to
      demonstrate any direct comparative studies assessing clinical performance of
      single implant-supported crowns and tooth-supported fixed partial dentures. The
      analysis suggested differences at 60 months between survival of implant-supported
      single crowns and natural tooth-supported fixed prostheses when resin-bonded and 
      conventionally retained fixed prostheses were grouped. This difference
      disappeared when implant-supported single crowns were compared with
      conventionally retained fixed partial dentures at 60 months. For other time
      periods, direct comparative data were unavailable.

      of various types of composite buildups, full-contour lithium disilicate crowns
      (with or without post) or a lithium disilicate endocrown. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 
      One hundred five sound molars were endodontically treated and randomly assigned
      to 1 control group (endodontic access cavity only) and 6 experimental groups
      (n=15): glass fiber reinforced composite (GFRC group), direct microhybrid
      composite (C group), direct microhybrid composite restoration with glass fiber
      post (CP group), composite buildup and full-contour lithium disilicate crown (LDS
      group), additional glass fiber post (P-LDS group), and endocrown (EC group).
      Molar crowns in the treatment groups were removed 1 mm above the cementoenamel
      junction and restored. All specimens were thermomechanically aged (1.2x10(6)
      cycles at 1.7 Hz/50N, 8000 cycles 5 degrees C to 55 degrees C) and axially loaded
      until failure. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc
      test (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Fracture strength was significantly affected by the
      type of restoration (p=0.000; statistically similar groups identified with
      superscript letters): LDS(B) (3217+/-1052 N), P-LDS(AB) (2697+/-665 N), EC(AB)
      (2425+/-993 N), C(A) (2192+/-752), control(A) (1890+/-774 N), CP(A) (1830+/-590
      N), and GFRC(A) (1823+/-911 N). Group GFRC obtained significantly more repairable
      fractures than the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in fracture
      strength were obtained between LDS, the composite restorations, and control
      group. Direct composite restorations showed similar fracture strength as P-LDS
      and EC. Incorporating a glass fiber reinforced composite resulted in
      significantly more repairable failures.

TI  - Direct resin composite inlays/onlays: an 11 year follow-up.
PG  - 299-306
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to present an 11-year assessment of direct 
      resin composite inlays/onlays. METHODS: One-hundred Class II direct resin
      composite inlays and 34 direct resin composite restorations were placed in 40
      patients. The restorations were evaluated clinically, according to modified USPHS
      criteria, annually over a 11-year period. RESULTS: Of the 96 inlays/onlays and 33
      direct restorations evaluated at 11 years, 17. 7% in the inlay/onlay group and
      27.3% in the direct restorations group were assessed as unacceptable. The
      differences in longevity were not statistically significant. The main reasons for
      failure for the inlays/onlays and direct restorations were fracture (8.3 and 12. 
      1%, respectively), occlusal wear in contact areas (4.2 and 6.1%, respectively)
      and secondary caries (4.2 and 9.1%, respectively). Eight of the non-acceptable
      inlays/onlays and five of the direct restorations were replaced, while the other 
      ones were repaired with resin composite. Unacceptable wear was observed in
      occlusal contact areas of six restorations, in patients who were severe bruxers. 
      For the other restorations occlusal wear was not found to be a clinical problem
      and no difference was observed between the inlays/onlays and direct composite
      restorations. The marginal adaptation of the inlays/onlays was still good at the 
      end of the study. Ditching was only observed in a few inlays. A higher failure
      rate was observed in molar teeth than in premolar teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Good
      durability was observed for the direct resin composite inlay/onlay technique.
      Excellent marginal adaptation and low frequency of secondary caries in patients
      with high caries risk were shown. No apparent improvement of mechanical
      properties was obtained by the secondary heat treatment of the inlays. Also, the 
      difference in failure rate between the resin composite direct technique and the
      inlay technique was not large, indicating that the more time-consuming and
      expensive inlay technique may not be justified. The direct inlay/onlay technique 
      is recommended to be used in Class II cavities of high caries risk patients with 
      cervical marginal placed in dentin.

TI  - Long-term survival of endodontically treated molars without crown coverage: a
      retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 164-70
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Teeth are weakened after endodontic treatment and should,
      ideally, be crowned, especially posterior teeth. However, this is not always
      possible. Information about the longevity of endodontically treated teeth without
      crown coverage may assist in selecting appropriate treatment modalities. PURPOSE:
      The aims of this cohort study were to evaluate the survival rate for
      endodontically treated molars without crown coverage and to identify possible
      related factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 220 endodontically treated
      permanent molar teeth in 203 subjects on a waiting list for fixed prosthodontic
      treatment at the Faculty of Dentistry-Mahidol University, Thailand, were
      included. Follow-up data were derived from a clinical examination and review of
      the dental record and radiographs. Subjects were not included in the study if
      teeth had provisional crowns, definitive restorations with cuspal coverage, or
      with dowel and core and/or crown restorations. The outcome evaluated was defined 
      as a failure if there were negative findings in the condition of a tooth that
      required a restoration, tooth repair, or extraction. Tooth loss due to endodontic
      and periodontal reasons was excluded. The independent variables assessed were
      patient age, gender, location (maxilla or mandible), the existence of an opposing
      dentition and adjacent teeth, remaining tooth structure, and types of restorative
      material. Kaplan-Meier analysis with a 95% confidence level was used to calculate
      the survival probability, and a log-rank test was used to determine whether
      significant differences existed. RESULTS: Overall survival rates of
      endodontically treated molars without crowns at 1, 2, and 5 years were 96%, 88%, 
      and 36%, respectively. With greater amounts of coronal tooth structure remaining,
      the survival probability increased. Molar teeth with maximum tooth structure
      remaining after endodontic treatment had a survival rate of 78% at 5 years.
      Restorations with direct composite had a better survival rate than conventional
      amalgam and reinforced zinc oxide and eugenol with polymethacrylate restorations.
      CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, the amount of remaining tooth
      structure and types of restorative material have significant association with the
      longevity of endodontically treated molars without crown coverage.

TI  - Fracture resistance of teeth restored with onlays of three contemporary
      tooth-colored resin-bonded restorative materials.
PG  - 167-71
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: There are uncertainties regarding the use of large indirect
      composites and ceramics in the restoration of posterior teeth. PURPOSE: This
      study investigated the fracture resistance of teeth restored with restorations of
      3 contemporary resin-bonded tooth-colored materials placed in a standardized
      onlay preparation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A random sample of preparations for
      tooth-colored onlays was obtained from a full service dental laboratory. A
      preparation was then duplicated in 30 natural teeth by copy milling. An
      additional 10 teeth were not prepared, and acted as a control. Ten onlays of each
      of the 3 materials (Belle Glass, SR Isosit, and Empress) were produced and resin 
      bonded into place according to the manufacturers' instructions. The restorations 
      were compressively loaded to fracture and the mode of failure recorded. RESULTS: 
      The fracture resistances obtained for the teeth restored with the composite
      material (mean 1.56 kN; SD 0.54) were greater than those obtained for the teeth
      restored with the ceramic material (mean 0.99 kN; SD 0.49) and the
      fiber-reinforced composite material (mean 0.99 kN; SD 0.56). CONCLUSION: Teeth
      restored with composite onlay restorations demonstrated a higher fracture
      resistance than equivalent sized onlay restorations produced from
      fiber-reinforced composite or a ceramic material. Failure under compressive
      loading may be found to be less catastrophic when a fiber-reinforced composite
      rather than a composite or ceramic material is used.

TI  - The effect of glass ionomer cement or composite resin bases on restoration of
      cuspal stiffness of endodontically treated premolars in vitro.
PG  - 77-83
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to decide whether composite resin or
      conventional glass ionomer cement should be preferred as a base material in
      endodontically treated premolars. Twelve extracted human maxillary premolars were
      mounted in a universal testing machine at a 35 degrees angle. Cuspal stiffness
      was determined by applying a load of 75 N to the buccal cusp and recording the
      displacement of the cusp using inductive displacement transducers. In the same
      teeth, different cavity preparations and restorations were performed
      sequentially. Standard MOD cavities were enlarged to allow endodontic access. In 
      addition, the cusps were undermined. Half of the teeth were restored to the level
      of the previous shallow cavities using conventional glass ionomer cement (Ketac
      Fil), in the rest of the teeth dentine bonding agent (Syntac) and composite resin
      (Tetric) were used instead. Finally, composite resin fillings (Tetric) were
      placed. All restorations were removed and the experiments were repeated twice.
      For each replication, the assignment of the base materials to the experimental
      groups was reversed, and ceramic inlays (Empress) were used as final restorations
      for the last replication. Improvement of cuspal stiffness achieved by
      conventional glass ionomer bases was very small, whereas composite resin bases
      increased cuspal stability by more than a factor of two. After placement of the
      final restorations, however, there was no longer a difference between teeth with 
      different base materials. Nevertheless, composite resin bases might be preferred 
      for two reasons. Firstly, deterioration of adhesive restorations will probably
      start at the cavosurface margins. The incidence of margin gaps, however, will not
      only compromise marginal seal but also the stabilizing effect of the restoration.
      In this situation, the resin base may still stabilize the tooth. Moreover, resin 
      bases may reduce the risk of cusp fracture during the time between cavity
      preparation and the insertion of adhesive inlays.

TI  - Effect of different onlay systems on fracture resistance and failure pattern of
      endodontically treated mandibular molars restored with and without glass fiber
      posts.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between post and core build-up materials
      on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored with
      different onlay restorations. METHODS: 60 mandibular molars were endodontically
      treated and divided into three experimental groups that received one of the
      following onlay restorations: gold onlays, glass ceramic onlays (Empress I), or
      resin composite onlays (Gradia). Half of the specimens in each group received a
      fiber post (n=10). Two controls groups (n=10) were included: one group composed
      of sound mandibular molars, and the second group was composed of endodontically
      treated unrestored molars. Fracture tests were carried out by applying axial load
      using a universal loading machine until fracture. All fractured specimens were
      fractographically examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Data were 
      analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison tests (alpha=0.05).
      RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that restoration of endodontically treated
      teeth with gold onlays improved fracture resistance when compared to glass
      ceramic or resin composite onlays. The presence of a fiber post significantly
      improved (P<0.045) fracture resistance of gold onlays from 2271 to 2874N while it
      did not influence the performance of the other two groups. Fractographic analyses
      revealed that the presence of fiber post resulted in more restorable fractures
      due to better stress distribution of the applied load. All onlay systems resulted
      in significant improvement of the fracture resistance compared to unrestored
      teeth (711N) but neither of them resulted in restoring the fracture resistance to
      match that of sound teeth (3212 N).

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Dental fractures can occur in endodontically treated teeth 
      restored with glass fiber reinforced posts and cast gold posts. PURPOSE: The
      objective of this study was to record the fracture strength of endodontically
      treated teeth restored with glass fiber reinforced or cast gold post and cores
      cemented with 3 cements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-two single-rooted premolars 
      with standardized weakened roots were endodontically treated and allocated to 6
      experimental groups (n=7) defined by the 2 factors investigated: post system and 
      cement. Three groups were restored with glass fiber posts and resin-modified
      glass ionomer cement, dual-polymerizing resin cement, or chemically active
      autopolymerizing resin cement. The other 3 groups were restored with cast gold
      post and cores and the same 3 cements. The cores of the glass fiber post groups
      were fabricated with composite resin core material. Metal crowns were cemented on
      the cores in the 6 groups. The entire system was subjected to continuous
      compression in a universal testing machine, and fracture limit and location
      (cervical third, middle third, or apical third) were noted. Two-way ANOVA and the
      Scheffe test were used to analyze the data and compare the groups (alpha=.05).
      RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA showed significant differences in the post type (P<.001)
      and the cements (P<.001). The interaction between them (P<.001) was statistically
      significant in the fracture resistance of the endodontically treated teeth. The
      greatest interaction between post and cement was the glass fiber post with
      resin-modified glass ionomer cement, followed by the cast gold post and core with
      resin-modified glass ionomer cement. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a glass fiber
      reinforced post and resin-modified glass ionomer cement increased the fracture
      resistance of endodontically treated teeth.

TI  - Fracture load of composite resin and feldspathic all-ceramic CAD/CAM crowns.
PG  - 117-23
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Various machinable materials are currently used with
      computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technologies for 
      the chairside fabrication of restorations. However, properties of these new
      machinable materials, such as fracture load, wear, marginal deterioration, and
      color stability, should be investigated in vitro under replicated clinical
      conditions prior to time-consuming clinical studies. PURPOSE: This study
      investigated the effect of cyclic loading fatigue and different luting agents
      under wet conditions on the fracture load of CAD/CAM machined composite resin and
      all-ceramic crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six intact human maxillary
      premolars were prepared for composite resin and all-ceramic crowns with the
      following preparation criteria: 6-degree axial taper, 1.5-mm shoulder finish line
      placed 0.5 mm occlusal to the cemento-enamel junction, 1.5-mm axial reduction,
      2-mm occlusal reduction, and 5-mm occluso-gingival height. Sixteen unprepared
      premolars served as controls. Forty-eight all-ceramic crowns (Vita Mark II) and
      48 millable composite resin crowns (MZ100 Block) were fabricated using a CAD/CAM 
      system (Cerec 3). Three luting agents-RelyX ARC (RX), GC Fuji CEM (FC), and zinc 
      phosphate cement (ZP)-were used for cementation (n = 16). After 1-week storage in
      water, half of the specimens (n=8) in each subgroup were cyclically loaded and
      thermal cycled under wet conditions for 600,000 masticatory cycles and 3500
      thermal cycles (58 degrees C/4 degrees C; dwell time, 60 seconds) in a
      masticatory simulator; the other half (n = 8) were fractured without cyclic
      loading. All specimens were loaded in a universal testing machine with a
      compressive load (N) applied along the long axis of the specimen at a crosshead
      speed of 1 mm/min until fracture. Fracture loads (N) were recorded for each
      specimen. Three-way analysis of variance was used to detect the effects of the
      experimental factors (crown material, luting agent, and loading conditions) on
      the fracture load. The comparison with the unprepared natural teeth as controls
      was done by means of t tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed 
      a statistically significant influence of the luting agent and the cyclic loading 
      (P < .001), whereas the crown material had no significant influence. Cyclic
      loading fatigue significantly decreased the mean fracture load of test groups
      independent of the 3 luting agents used: MZ100/ZP, 827.1 to 552.5 N; MZ100/FC,
      914.7 to 706.2 N; MZ100/RX, 955.9 to 724.4 N; Vita/ZP, 772.3 to 571.5 N; Vita/FC,
      923.6 to 721.1 N; and Vita/RX, 929.1 to 752.7 N. However, there was no
      significant difference in the mean fracture load of control specimens before and 
      after cyclic loading (1140.1 N and 1066.2 N, respectively). Adhesive luting
      agents RelyX ARC and GC Fuji CEM increased fracture load significantly compared
      to zinc phosphate cement. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclic loading fatigue significantly
      reduced the fracture loads of composite resin and all-ceramic crowns, whereas
      adhesive cementation significantly increased the fracture loads.

TI  - Leucite-reinforced glass ceramic inlays and onlays after six years: clinical
      behavior.
PG  - 459-65
AB  - Ceramic inlays are an esthetic substitute for large amalgam and other metallic
      restorations. This controlled clinical study evaluated the performance of IPS
      Empress inlays and onlays with cuspal replacements and proximal margins below the
      cementoenamel junction over six years of clinical service. Six dentists placed 96
      ceramic restorations in 34 patients. Luting was accomplished using the
      enamel-etch-technique, a dentin bonding system (Syntac Classic) and four
      different composite systems. The restorations were assessed by two calibrated
      investigators using modified USPHS criteria at baseline (96 restorations), one
      (96), two (95), four (89) and six years (67). Seven of the 96 restorations
      investigated had to be replaced (failure rate 7%; Kaplan-Meier): Five inlays
      suffered cohesive bulk fractures and two teeth required endodontic treatment.
      After six years of clinical service, significant deterioration (Friedman 2-way
      ANOVA; p < 0.05) was found for marginal adaptation of the remaining restorations.
      Ninety-four percent of the surviving restorations exhibited marginal
      deficiencies, independent of the luting composite. Neither the absence of enamel 
      margins, nor cuspal replacement significantly affected the quality of the
      restorations.

TI  - Influence of restorative technique on the biomechanical behavior of
      endodontically treated maxillary premolars. Part II: strain measurement and
      stress distribution.
PG  - 114-22
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(08)60027-X [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Unresolved controversy exists concerning the preferred
      cavity design and restorative technique used to restore endodontically treated
      maxillary premolars to minimize strain and improve stress distribution under
      occlusal load. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of
      cavity design and restorative material on strain measurement and stress
      distribution in maxillary premolars under occlusal loading conditions, and
      correlate these influences with the failure modes analyzed in Part I. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: For the strain gauge test, 21 additional specimens were prepared as 
      described in Part 1 of this study (n=3). Two strain gauges were fixed on the
      buccal (B) and palatal (P) cusps of each specimen with cyanoacrylate adhesive.
      The specimens were submitted to continuous axial compression loading at a speed
      of 0.5 mm/min, using a 6-mm sphere, to a maximum limit of 150 N in a universal
      testing machine. Total strain values were obtained by combining the B and P cusp 
      strain values. These values were submitted to 2-way ANOVA and the Dunnet test
      (alpha=.05). For finite element analyses, 7 numerical 2-D models were generated: 
      MODd, direct mesio-occlusal-distal preparation; MODi, indirect
      mesio-occlusal-distal preparation; AM, MODd restored with amalgam; CR, MODd
      restored with composite resin; LPR, MODi restored with laboratory-processed
      composite resin; and LGC, MODi restored with leucite-reinforced glass ceramic;
      each corresponding to 1 of the experimental groups tested in Part I of this
      study. The models were analyzed with finite element software, using the von Mises
      criteria for stress distribution analysis. RESULTS: With the strain gauge test,
      MODd, MODi, and AM groups showed significantly higher strain values than the CR, 
      LPR, and LGC. Finite element analyses revealed that tooth structure removal and
      the type of restorative material altered the stress distribution pattern. The
      MODd, MODi, AM, and LPR models showed higher stress concentration within the
      tooth structure. CONCLUSIONS: The specimens with adhesive restorations were shown
      to behave in a manner similar to the biomechanical behavior of healthy teeth,
      while the behavior of those restored with amalgam restorations was more like that
      observed for teeth with nonrestored cavity preparations. These results directly
      correlate with the fracture mode results obtained in Part I of this study.

TI  - Influence of the type of post and core on in vitro marginal continuity, fracture 
      resistance, and fracture mode of lithia disilicate-based all-ceramic crowns.
PG  - 264-73
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(08)60205-X [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The influence of different crown foundations on marginal
      seal and fracture resistance of ceramic crowns placed on endodontically treated
      teeth has not been clearly established. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the marginal continuity and fracture behavior of high-strength
      all-ceramic crowns with different substructures in endodontically treated
      premolars. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight human mandibular premolars were
      assigned to 6 groups, including a no-treatment group (UNTREATED) and a group for 
      which the access cavity was restored with composite resin (Tetric Ceram) (COMP). 
      In the remaining 4 groups, teeth were prepared to receive all-ceramic crowns with
      0.8-mm-wide shoulders and axial dentin heights of 2 mm. No posts were used in the
      ENDOCROWN group. Glass fiber posts (FRC Postec) were used in group FRC-POST.
      Group ZRO-POST received zirconia ceramic posts (CosmoPost), and group GOLD-POST
      received cast gold posts (CM). Experimental lithia disilicate ceramic crowns were
      made and adhesively cemented (Variolink). All teeth were subjected to thermal
      cycling and mechanical loading (TCML) in a masticatory simulator (1,200,000
      loads, 49 N, 1.7 Hz, 3000 temperature cycles of 5 degrees C-50 degrees C-5
      degrees C). Marginal continuity was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy
      at x200. All specimens were loaded to failure in a universal testing machine at
      0.5 mm/min after TCML. Data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and post hoc t tests 
      with Bonferroni correction (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Initially, mean values (SD)
      between 72.4 (15.8)% (ENDOCROWN) and 94.8 (3)% (FRC-POST) for continuous margins 
      were found. With TCML, marginal continuity decreased significantly only in
      FRC-POST, to 75.5 (8.4)%, and in ENDOCROWN, to 44.7 (14.5)%. Mechanical load
      testing measured mean loads to failure between 1092.4 (307.8) N (FRC-POST) and
      1253.7 (226.5) N (ZRO-POST) without significant differences between groups. Deep 
      root fractures were observed in half of the specimens, irrespective of their
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Marginal continuity of the crowns studied was better and
      more stress resistant when posts and cores were included in the restoration of
      endodontically treated teeth with complete ceramic crowns. The placement of a
      post-and-core foundation did not influence the pattern of failure.

TI  - Utilization of ceromer inlays/onlays for replacement of amalgam restorations.
PG  - 405-12; quiz 414
AB  - Fiber-reinforced Ceromer technology has been recommended for a variety of
      restorations, including inlays/onlays, crowns and bridges, and direct
      restorations. Ideal restorative dental materials must exhibit adequate physical
      properties and fit, as well as ease and predictability of fabrication and repair.
      The Ceromer restorative material combines the positive attributes of indirect
      composite restorations, feldspathic ceramics, and cast-gold restorations. This
      article reviews the material properties and aesthetic characteristics inherent to
      Ceromers, as well as the appropriate preparation and adhesive techniques for
      inlay/onlay restorations.

TI  - Survival and Success Rates of Monolithic Zirconia Restorations Supported by Teeth
      and Implants in Bruxer versus Non-Bruxer Patients: A Retrospective Study.
LID - 833 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15030833 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess retrospectively the survival and success
      rates of monolithic zirconia restorations supported by teeth and implants in
      bruxer versus non-bruxer patients. Methods: A total of 15 bruxer and 25
      non-bruxer patients attended the recall appointment. The bruxer group (mean age
      of 61.2 +/- 13.3 years and follow-up of 58.7 +/- 16.8 months) were treated with
      331 monolithic zirconia restorations, while the non-bruxer group, with a
      comparable mean age and follow-up time, were treated with 306 monolithic zirconia
      restorations. Clinical data were retrieved from the patients' files. At the
      recall appointment, all supporting teeth and implants were examined for
      biological and technical complications, and the restorations were evaluated using
      modified California Dental Association (CDA) criteria. Data were statistically
      analyzed using survival analysis methods. A significance level of p < 0.05 was
      used. A total of 31 versus 27 biologic and technical complications were recorded 
      in the bruxer and non-bruxer groups, respectively. No significant differences
      were found between the two groups regarding overall complications and survival
      rate. Regarding the type of complication, a significantly higher rate of veneered
      porcelain chipping (p = 0.045) was observed in the bruxer group. With regard to
      biological complications, the only complications that exhibited a borderline,
      although not significant, difference were three fractured teeth exclusively in
      the bruxer group (p = 0.051), which were replaced with implant-supported
      restorations. Within the limitations of this study, we conclude that there were
      no significant differences in the overall survival and success rates of the
      monolithic zirconia restorations in bruxer versus non-bruxer patients, although
      veneered zirconia restorations and single tooth abutments exhibited a higher rate
      of complications in the bruxer group.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Ceramic restorations are frequently being placed due to the
      esthetic demand and the cost of noble metals that has increased considerably. One
      major disadvantage of ceramic restoration is failure of the material due to
      fracture by crack propagation. In vitro studies are of little clinical
      significance and in vivo studies are too short to support clinical success.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the failure rate
      of lithium disilicate restorations (monolithic and layered) at 4 years. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: Data were collected over 45 months from 2 commercial laboratories.
      Restorations were categorized into monolithic restorations and layered
      restorations. Each category was further classified into complete coverage single 
      crowns, fixed dental prostheses, e.max veneers, and inlay/onlay restorations.
      Failure rates were compared and analyzed using Chi-square (alpha=.05). RESULTS: A
      total of 21,340 restorations were evaluated in this study and included 15,802
      monolithic restorations and 5538 layered restorations. The failure rate for
      single crown monolithic restorations was 0.91% and was 1.83% for single crown
      layered restorations. For fixed dental prostheses, 4.55% of monolithic
      restorations failed. For e.max veneers, 1.3% of monolithic veneers fractured and 
      1.53% of layered veneers fractured. Of the inlay/onlay restorations group, 1.01% 
      of monolithic restorations fractured. CONCLUSION: In the short term (45 months), 
      restorations fabricated with the lithium disilicate material (IPS e.max) had
      relatively low fracture rates. Layered single crowns fractured at approximately 2
      times the rate of monolithic crowns.

TI  - Fracture resistance of endodontically treated molars restored with extensive
      composite resin restorations.
PG  - 225-32
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(08)60047-5 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: When cuspal coverage is required, there is no evidence that
      indirect composite resin restorations are superior to direct restorations in
      terms of biomechanical behavior. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was 
      to compare the fracture resistance of cusp-replacing direct and indirect
      composite resin restorations in endodontically treated molars. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Forty-five human mandibular molars were selected and divided into 3
      groups (n=15): DIR specimens, restored with direct composite resin (Estelite
      Sigma) restorations; IND specimens, restored with indirect composite resin
      (Estelite Sigma) restorations, and control specimens, which remained intact.
      Endodontic treatment was performed using NiTi ProTaper rotary instruments, and
      teeth were filled using lateral condensation of gutta-percha and sealer.
      Extensive Class II MO cavities were prepared, and the 2 mesial cusps were
      reduced, allowing a 2-mm layer of composite resin. All teeth were prepared to the
      same dimensions, considering reasonable human variation. Specimens were loaded to
      failure and the fracture loads were recorded (N). The mode of fracture was
      determined using a stereomicroscope and classified as favorable or unfavorable
      failure. The data were subjected to a Kruskal-Wallis test, multiple-comparison
      Mann-Whitney test, and a chi-square test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Significant
      differences (P<.001) were observed between the control group and both DIR and IND
      groups. However, no significant difference was found between the DIR and IND
      groups. The chi-square test did not show a significant difference in the
      frequencies of favorable/unfavorable failure modes among the 3 groups (P=.981).
      CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was observed in the fracture resistance of
      endodontically treated molars restored to original contours with an extensive
      cusp-replacing direct or indirect composite resin restoration.

TI  - Long-term survival of endodontically treated, maxillary anterior teeth restored
      with either tapered or parallel-sided glass-fiber posts and full-ceramic crown
      coverage.
PG  - 115-21
LID - 10.1016/j.jdent.2008.10.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study investigated the clinical effectiveness over
      up to 8 years of parallel-sided and of tapered glass-fiber posts, in combination 
      with either hybrid composite or dual-cure composite resin core material, in
      endodontically treated, maxillary anterior teeth covered with full-ceramic
      crowns. METHODS: The study population comprised 192 patients and 526
      endodontically treated teeth, with various degrees of hard-tissue loss, restored 
      by the post-and-core technique. Four groups were defined based on post shape and 
      core build-up materials, and within each group post-and-core restorations were
      assigned randomly with respect to root morphology. Inclusion criteria were
      symptom-free endodontic therapy, root-canal treatment with a minimum apical seal 
      of 4mm, application of rubber dam, need for post-and-core complex because of
      coronal tooth loss, and tooth with at least one residual coronal wall. Survival
      rate of the post-and-core restorations was determined using Kaplan-Meier
      statistical analysis. RESULTS: The restorations were examined clinically and
      radiologically; mean observation period was 5.3 years. The overall survival rate 
      of glass-fiber post-and-core restorations was 98.5%. The survival rate for
      parallel-sided posts was 98.6% and for tapered posts was 96.8%. Survival rates
      for core build-up materials were 100% for dual-cure composite and 96.8% for
      hybrid light-cure composite. CONCLUSIONS: For both glass-fiber post designs and
      for both core build-up materials, clinical performance was satisfactory. Survival
      was higher for teeth retaining four and three coronal walls.

TI  - Does the type of implant prosthesis affect outcomes in the partially edentulous
      patient?
PG  - 140-72
AB  - PURPOSE: Implant restoration of the partially edentulous patient has become
      highly predictable. The scientific information on the specifics of restorative
      designs and their influence on the long-term outcome is sparse. The main
      objective of this systematic review was to determine what scientific evidence
      exists regarding the influence of prosthodontic design features on the long-term 
      outcomes of implant therapy (implant success and survival, prosthesis success and
      survival) in the partially edentulous patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four
      questions of primary interest regarding implant prosthodontic design options were
      selected by the 2 reviewers: abutment type, retention type (cemented,
      screw-retained), support type (implant support alone versus combined
      implant-tooth support), and the type of restorative material. Inclusion and
      exclusion criteria were formulated and applied to a total of 1,720 titles. The
      list of titles was primarily based on a PubMed-type search provided by the State 
      of the Science of Implant Dentistry workshop leadership. It was supplemented by a
      hand search of relevant journals at the Countway Library of the Harvard Medical
      School and of a personal collection of relevant publications of the 2 reviewers. 
      Information on the survival and success of implants and prostheses as defined by 
      the respective authors was retrieved from the included articles, entered into
      data extraction tables, and submitted for statistical analysis. RESULTS:
      Seventy-four articles were selected for data extraction and analysis after
      critical appraisal and application of the exclusion criteria. The kappa value for
      reviewer agreement was 100% between the 2 reviewers. The majority of studies were
      in the ""average"" range and were published between 1995 and 2003. Only 2 ""best""
      trials, ie, randomized controlled clinical trials, were identified. For the
      method of retention (screw-retained versus cemented), no differences were found
      in implant success or survival rates between screw-retained and cemented
      restorations. Prosthesis success rates showed greater variations between cemented
      and screw-retained restorations at the various evaluation times; however, the
      differences never reached statistical significance. The prosthesis success rate
      at the last reported examination (> 72 mo) was 93.2% for cemented and 83.4% for
      screw-retained restorations (P > .05). Regarding the type of support, implant
      success rates at the last reported evaluation were 97.1% for implant-supported
      fixed partial dentures (FPDs), 94.3% for single-implant restorations, and 89.2%
      for implant-tooth-supported FPDs. None of the differences reached statistical
      significance. Implant survival at the last examination (> 72 mo) was highest for 
      implant-supported FPDs (97.7%), followed by single-implant restorations (95.6%)
      and implant-tooth-supported FPDs (91.1%). Differences were not statistically
      significant. Prosthesis success at the last examination (> 72 mo) resulted in
      overall lower percentage rates than implant success or survival (89.7% for
      implant-supported FPDs, 87.5% for implant-tooth-supported FPDs, and 85.4% for
      single-implant restorations; differences not statistically significant).
      Insufficient extractable information was available regarding the influence of
      abutment type or restorative material. CONCLUSION: The scientific evidence

TI  - Composite Resin Core Buildups With and Without Post for the Restoration of
      Endodontically Treated Molars Without Ferrule.
PG  - 64-75
LID - 10.2341/14-258-L [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the restoration of highly
      damaged, broken-down endodontically treated molars without the ferrule effect
      using glass ceramic crowns on different dual-cure composite resin core buildups. 
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty (N=30, n=15) decoronated, endodontically treated
      teeth (no ferrule) were restored without a ferrule with a direct buildup using
      the dual-curing composite Multicore HB (group MHB) or the dual-curing composite
      core buildup Multicore Flow in combination with glass-fiber-reinforced composite 
      post (FRC post; group MFP). All teeth were prepared to receive bonded glass
      ceramic crowns (Empress CAD luted with Variolink II) and were subjected to
      accelerated fatigue testing. Cyclic isometric loading was applied to the palatal 
      cusp at an angle of 30 degrees and a frequency of 5 Hz, beginning with a load of 
      200 N (x5000 cycles), followed by stages of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 N
      at a maximum of 30,000 cycles each. Specimens were loaded until failure or to a
      maximum of 185,000 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table survival
      analysis (log rank test at p=0.05). Average fracture loads and number of survived
      cycles were compared with one-way analysis of variance (Scheffe post hoc at
      p=0.05). Previously published data from the same authors about core buildups made
      of high-performance polymers (group HPP, n=15) and light-curing composite resin
      without FRC posts (group TEC, n=15) and with FRC posts (group TECP, n=15) using
      the same experimental setup were included for comparison. RESULTS: None of the
      tested specimen withstood all 185,000 load cycles. There was no significant
      difference in mean fracture load (p=0.376), survived cycles (p=0.422), and
      survival (p=0.613) between MHB (facture load 859.4 N+/-194.92) and MFP (796.13
      N+/-156.34). Group HPP from a previous study appeared to have significantly
      higher performance than all other groups except MHB. All groups with posts were
      affected by an initial failure phenomenon (wide gap at the margin between the
      buildup/crown assembly and the root). CONCLUSIONS: HPP and MHB enhanced the
      performance of all-ceramic leucite-reinforced glass ceramic crowns, and insertion
      of a fiber-reinforced composite post was not influential when using other
      materials.

TI  - Fit of zirconia fixed partial dentures fabricated from conventional impressions
      and digital scans: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - S0022-3913(21)00496-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.08.025 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Available studies comparing fit accuracy of zirconia fixed 
      partial dentures (FPDs) fabricated from conventional impressions and digital
      scans provide contradictory results. In addition, studies have been heterogeneous
      and of a limited number to provide conclusive evidence. PURPOSE: The purpose of
      this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the marginal and intaglio
      fit of tooth-supported zirconia FPDs fabricated from conventional impressions and
      digital scans and to investigate the effect of different variables on the fit
      results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search was performed on the National
      Library of Medicine (NLM), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and
      Scopus databases. In addition, a manual search was carried out. Studies comparing
      the fit of tooth-supported zirconia FPDs fabricated from conventional impressions
      and digital scans and reporting sufficient data for qualitative and quantitative 
      analysis were included. Standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated for meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed
      to study the effect of variables including restoration form (monolithic or
      framework), units number, intraoral scanner (IOS) type, conventional impression
      material, spacer thickness, and abutments region. RESULTS: The initial search
      resulted in a total of 608 articles. Nine articles were included in the analysis 
      (1 clinical and 8 in vitro) evaluating 118 restorations. Digital scan displayed
      significantly better marginal fit (P<.001; SMD: -0.68; 95% CI: -0.92, -0.09) and 
      intaglio fit (P=.020; SMD: -0.51; 95% CI: -0.94, -0.42). Test for subgroup
      difference showed a significant influence of only impression material type
      (P=.008) and units number (P=.030) on marginal fit. Digital scan showed
      significantly better marginal accuracy for 3-unit FPDs than 4-unit FPDs (P<.001; 
      SMD: -1.02; 95% CI: -1.41, -0.63). In addition, digital scanning had
      significantly better marginal fit with polyvinyl siloxane than polyether (P<.001;
      SMD: -0.98; 95% CI: -1.32, -0.64). A cement spacer </=50 mum improved both
      marginal and intaglio fit in the digital group. The TRIOS scanner resulted in the
      best performance in the digital group for marginal fit. CONCLUSIONS: Digital
      scanning provides significantly better marginal and intaglio fit than
      conventional impression making for fabricating zirconia FPDs up to 4 units,
      either in monolithic form or frameworks and at any region of the arch. However,
      further clinical studies are recommended to obtain more substantial results.

TI  - All-ceramic fixed partial dentures. Studies on aluminum oxide- and zirconium
      dioxide-based ceramic systems.
PG  - 1-69
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of refined, tougher, and stronger ceramic core
      materials in recent years has led to the wider use of new, strong all-ceramic
      systems based on oxide ceramics. Results from in-vitro studies investigating the 
      use of oxide ceramics in shorter all-ceramic fixed partial dentures (FPDs) have
      been positive, but clinical studies and additional in-vitro studies are needed to
      confirm the advisability of such procedures. AIMS: One aim of this thesis was to 
      investigate whether alumina-based and zirconia-based material systems are
      adequate for use in shorter (< or = five-unit) FPDs and to evaluate the clinical 
      results. Additional aims were to investigate how to achieve optimal fracture
      strength in an all-ceramic FPD by varying the try-in procedure, the cervical
      shape of the abutments, and the support of the FPD (abutment teeth or dental
      implants). The final aim was to compare the strength of a zirconia material
      system with that of an alumina equivalent with known long-term clinical
      performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two clinical studies investigating one
      alumina-based and one zirconia-based material system were performed. Twenty
      posterior, three-unit FPDs (glass-infiltrated alumina) were followed for 5 years 
      and 20 three-five-unit FPDs (HIP zirconia) for 2 years. Long-term follow-ups were
      made after 11 +/-1 (glass-infiltrated alumina) and 3 years (HIP zirconia). In
      three in-vitro studies, the following variables were investigated: (1a) the
      flexural strength of porcelain specimens depending on whether they were exposed
      to saliva before the glaze firing (n=20) or first after the glaze firing (n=20), 
      (1b) the fracture strength of three-unit all-ceramic FPDs (glass-infiltrated
      alumina) supported by abutments prepared with cervical shoulder preparations
      (n=9) and abutments with cervical chamfer preparations (n=9), (2) the fracture
      strength of crowns (n=30) made of a zirconia material system (densely sintered
      zirconia) and of crowns (n=30) of an alumina material system (densely sintered
      alumina) that had undergone three different pre-treatment modalities (water
      storage only; water storage and cyclic pre-loading; water storage, cyclic
      pre-loading, and thermocycling), (3) the fracture strength of all-ceramic FPDs
      (densely sintered alumina) supported by simulated teeth (n=12) or by dental
      implants (n=12). RESULTS: The success rate of the clinical alumina study was 90% 
      after 5 years. Six (+/-1) years later (after a total of 11 +/-1 years), the
      success/survival rate was 65%. In the second clinical study, the success rates of
      the 2- and 3-year follow-ups were 100%. In the three in-vitro studies, the
      following results were found: (1a) the mean flexural strength of the specimens in
      the group that was exposed to saliva first after glazing was significantly higher
      (P < 0.001) than that of the specimens in the group that was exposed to saliva
      before glazing, (1b) the FPDs luted on shoulder preparations resisted higher
      loads than the FPDs luted on chamfer preparations (P = 0.051), 2) total fractures
      were more frequent in the alumina than in the zirconia group (P < 0.001), 3) FPDs
      loaded on implants resisted higher loads (mean = 604 N, SD=184 N ) than FPDs
      loaded on abutment teeth (mean= 378 N, SD=152 N, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This
      thesis justifies the use of shorter alumina- (< or = three-unit) and
      zirconia-based (< or = five-unit) FPDs as the clinical results are acceptable.
      The clinical performance of alumina is, however, not as good as that of
      comparable high-gold alloy based porcelain-fused-to-metal FPDs concerning
      fracture resistance. Within the limitations of the in-vitro studies: Saliva
      exposure of porcelain before glaze firing should be avoided to optimize the
      strength of the porcelain. Shoulder preparations can be beneficial for the
      strength of all-ceramic FPDs compared to chamfer preparations, as can support by 
      dental implants compared to abutment teeth. The fracture mode of alumina crowns
      (total fractures) differs from that of zirconia crowns (veneer fractures),
      suggesting that the zirconia core is stronger than the alumina core.

TI  - Clinical outcome of bonded partial indirect posterior restorations on vital and
      non-vital teeth: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 6597-6621
LID - 10.1007/s00784-021-04187-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The survival rate of indirect partial adhesive restorations on vital 
      versus endodontically treated teeth is still controversial. The hypothesis is
      that there may be a difference in the survival rate of partial adhesive
      restorations performed on non-vital teeth compared to vital teeth. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines.
      The considered clinical studies investigated the outcomes of adhesive inlays,
      onlays, and overlays conducted over the past 40 years, focusing on Kaplan-Meier
      survival curves to calculate the hazard ratio (primary objective) and the
      survival rate (secondary objective) between vital and non-vital teeth. The risk
      of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Studies included in the
      review were identified through bibliographic research on electronic databases
      (""PubMed,"" ""Scopus,"" ""Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial,"" and
      ""Embase""). The K agreement between the two screening reviewers was evaluated.
      RESULTS: A total of 55,793 records were identified on PubMed, Scopus, and other
      bibliographic sources, and after the application of the eligibility and inclusion
      criteria, eight articles were included for qualitative analysis and six for
      quantitative analysis. The meta-analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes
      demonstrated that hazard ratios (HR = 8.41, 95% CI: [4.50, 15.72]) and survival
      rates (OR = 3.24, 95% CI: [1.76, 5.82]) seemed more favorable for indirect
      partial adhesive restorations on vital teeth than for those on endodontically
      treated teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of this study, these findings
      suggest that the risk of failure of indirect partial adhesive restorations on
      endodontically treated teeth is higher than on vital teeth. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
      The use of partial adhesive restorations on vital and endodontically treated
      teeth showed different long-term clinical outcomes.

TI  - A systematic review of the survival and complication rates of fixed partial
      dentures (FPDs) after an observation period of at least 5 years. II. Combined
      tooth--implant-supported FPDs.
PG  - 643-53
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the 5- and
      10-year survival of combined tooth-implant-supported fixed partial dentures
      (FPDs) and the incidence of biological and technical complications. METHODS: An
      electronic MEDLINE search supplemented by manual searching was conducted to
      identify prospective and retrospective cohort studies on FPDs with a mean
      follow-up time of at least 5 years. Patients had to have been examined clinically
      at the follow-up visit. Assessment of the identified studies and data abstraction
      was performed independently by two reviewers. Failure and complication rates were
      analyzed using random-effects Poisson regression models to obtain summary
      estimates of 5- and 10-year survival proportions. RESULTS: From a total of 3844
      titles and 560 abstracts, 176 articles were selected for full-text analysis, and 
      13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of these studies indicated
      an estimated survival of implants in combined tooth-implant-supported FPDs of
      90.1% (95 percent confidence interval (95% CI): 82.4-94.5%) after 5 and 82.1%
      (95% CI: 55.8-93.6%) after 10 years. The survival rate of FPDs was 94.1% (95% CI:
      90.2-96.5%) after 5 and 77.8% (95% CI: 66.4-85.7%) after 10 years of function.
      There was no significant difference in survival of tooth and implant abutments in
      combined tooth-implant FPDs. After an observation period of 5 years, 3.2% (95%
      CI: 1.5-7.2%) of the abutment teeth and 3.4% (95% CI: 2.2-5.3%) of the
      functionally loaded implants were lost. After 10 years, the corresponding
      proportions were 10.6% (95% CI: 3.5-23.1%) for the abutment teeth and 15.6% (95% 
      CI: 6.5-29.5%) for the implants. After a 5 year observation period, intrusion was
      detected in 5.2% (95% CI: 2-13.3%) of the abutment teeth. Intrusion of abutment
      teeth were almost exclusively detected among non-rigid connections. CONCLUSION:
      Survival rates of both implants and reconstructions in combined
      tooth-implant-supported FPDs were lower than those reported for solely
      implant-supported FPDs (Pjetursson et al. 2004). Hence, planning of prosthetic
      rehabilitation may preferentially include solely implant-supported FPDs. However,
      anatomical aspects, patient centered issues and risk assessments of the residual 
      dentition may still justify combined tooth-implant-supported reconstructions. It 
      was evident from the present search that tooth-implant-supported FPDs have not
      been studied to any great extent and hence, there is a definitive need for more
      longitudinal studies examining these reconstructions.

TI  - The effect of different restoration techniques on the fracture resistance of
      endodontically-treated molars.
PG  - 526-33
LID - 10.2341/07-132 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study compared the fracture resistance of endodontically-treated
      mandibular molars with mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) cavities restored using
      different restoration techniques. METHODOLOGY: Sixty sound extracted mandibular
      molars were randomly assigned to six groups (n=10). Group 1 did not receive any
      preparation. The teeth in Groups 2-6 received root canal treatment and a MOD
      cavity preparation. The teeth in Group 2 were kept unrestored. Group 3 was
      restored conventionally with amalgam. Group 4 was restored with a dentin bonding 
      system (DBS, Clearfil SE Bond) and resin composite (CR) (Clearfil
      Photoposterior). Group 5 was restored with indirect hybrid ceramic inlay material
      (Estenia). In Group 6, polyethylene ribbon fiber (Ribbond) was inserted into
      cavities in a buccal-to-lingual direction and the teeth were then restored with
      DBS and CR. After finishing and polishing, the specimens, except for Group 2,
      were loaded to failure by a chewing simulation device (60,000 cycles x 50 N load,
      1.3 Hz frequency) in an artificial environment at 37 degrees C. Each tooth was
      subjected to compressive loading perpendicular to the occlusal surface at a
      crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute. The mean loads necessary to fracture were
      recorded in Newtons and the results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The
      mean fracture values were as follows: Group 1: 2485.3 +/- 193.98a, Group 2: 533.9
      +/- 59.4a, Group 3: 1705.8 +/- 135.7a, Group 4: 2033.3 +/- 137.6cd, Group 5:
      2121.3 +/- 156.5d, Group 6: 1908.9 +/- 132.2cd. There were statistically
      significant differences between the groups annotated with different letters.
      Thus, Group 1 (intact teeth) had the greatest fracture resistance and Group 2
      (non-restored teeth) the poorest. No statistically significant differences were
      found between Groups 3 (amalgam), 4 (resin composite) and 6 (polyethylene ribbon 
      fiber reinforced composite) (p > 0.05). Group 5 (indirect hybrid ceramic inlay)
      had greater fracture resistance than Group 3 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the 
      limitations of this study, although all of the restoration groups were stronger
      than the prepared-only group, none of the restoration techniques tested was able 
      to completely restore the fracture resistance lost from MOD cavity preparation.
      However, use of indirect hybrid inlay restorations in these teeth may be
      recommended, because this restoration technique indicated more favorable fracture
      failure modes than other restoration techniques used in this study and
      particularly greater fracture strength than amalgam restorations. The promising
      result of indirect hybrid inlay restorations may need to be confirmed by
      long-term clinical studies.

AB  - Computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems have proven effective
      not only for the manufacture of crown and bridge frameworks, inlays, onlays and
      veneers, but also for the generation of all-ceramic primary telescopic prostheses
      in more than 10 years of use in dental technology. The new InLab 4.0 software
      generation makes it possible to design and mill primary telescopic prostheses
      with CAD/CAM technology. The computer-generated raw crowns for these restorations
      require very little manual adaptation. The secondary crowns are manufactured by
      electroforming and bonded onto the tertiary structure or framework.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Lithium disilicate (LD) is a popular dental ceramic and has
      been a focus of dental research. Nevertheless, a quantified literature analysis
      focusing on the research of lithium disilicate is lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose
      of this bibliometric analysis was to review the progress of research into lithium
      disilicate in dentistry, including the identification of contributing
      researchers, organizations, countries or regions, journals, and the analysis of
      high-impact keywords and research trending. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The search was 
      carried out within the topic field of the Web of Science (WoS) database,
      collecting publications related to LD from between 1996 and 2019. Metadata
      including the titles, abstracts, keywords, authors, affiliations, countries or
      regions, and references were extracted. Bibliometric indicators in terms of
      documents, authors, journals, and keywords were analyzed. RESULTS: Between 1996
      and 2019, the dental research on LD trended upward. Scholars in the United
      States, Germany, Switzerland, and Brazil actively participated in the research on
      LD, and publications from the United States had the most citations. The Journal
      of Prosthetic Dentistry and Dental Materials were the major contributing
      journals. High-impact terms could be categorized into types of restorative
      material, types of prostheses, and properties or techniques of materials.
      Co-occurrence and relative normalized citation analysis of keywords highlighted
      several research interests, such as comparison studies between LD and zirconia,
      computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) techniques, and 
      the performance of complete coverage LD restorations. CONCLUSIONS: With the
      global upsurge in research on lithium disilicate, extensive collaborations and
      citations have been noted among authors, institutions, and countries or regions. 
      Research hotspots include types of restorative material, types of prostheses, and
      properties or techniques of materials.

TI  - Fracture resistance of endodontically treated maxillary premolars restored with
      CAD/CAM ceramic inlays.
PG  - 342-9
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Endodontically treated posterior teeth are more likely to
      fracture compared to posterior teeth with vital pulps. Reinforcement with an
      extracoronal restoration that covers the cusps is the most commonly recommended
      method for reducing the risk of fracture. It is not known whether bonded
      intracoronal restorations without cuspal coverage will reduce the risk of
      fracture. PURPOSE: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate whether
      reinforcement of endodontically treated premolars with MOD preparations could be 
      achieved by insertion of bonded CAD/CAM ceramic inlays. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Forty-five extracted maxillary premolars were equally distributed among 3 groups 
      (END, CER, CTR). In group END (n=15), root canals were enlarged with a rotary
      NiTi system and obturated with heat-softened gutta-percha around a plastic
      carrier (Thermafil). After filling of the endodontic access cavities with
      autopolymerizing composite resin (Luxacore), standardized MOD cavity preparations
      were made and CAD/CAM ceramic inlays (CEREC) were fabricated and then bonded to
      the teeth with composite resin (Tetric) and an adhesive system (Syntac Classic). 
      In group CER (n=15), teeth without endodontic treatment were restored with bonded
      inlays (CEREC). Sound premolars served as controls (group CTR, n=15). Teeth were 
      then thermal cycled (1445 cycles, dwell time: 30 seconds, 5 degrees /55 degrees
      C). An eccentric load was applied on the buccal incline of the palatal cusp in a 
      universal testing machine until cusp fracture (N). Fracture load was evaluated
      with the Mann-Whitney test, and type of fracture, with a chi-square analysis
      (alpha=.05). The type of fracture was determined by visual inspection: type I -
      supragingival fracture within the palatal cusp; type II - fracture below
      cemento-enamel junction of palatal cusp; and type III - fracture of palatal cusp 
      and central portion of the tooth exposing the root canal cavity. RESULTS: No
      significant difference was found among the 3 groups with respect to load required
      for fracture. Mean fracture load +/- SD was recorded as follows: 291.6 +/- 113.7 
      N for group END, 363.2 +/- 140.3 N for group CER, and 296.5 +/- 170.5 N for group
      CTR. Regarding fracture modes, significantly more teeth from group END exhibited 
      fractures of type III and II compared with control specimens. CONCLUSION: Teeth
      restored with bonded CAD/CAM ceramic inlays (CEREC) fractured with a
      significantly higher number of severe fractures compared to the control group.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of survival and complication rate of monolithic occlusal
      onlays made of lithium disilicate ceramic used in patients with severe tooth wear
      up to 11years of clinical service. METHODS: In a prospective non-randomized
      clinical study 7 patients (4 male, 3 female; median age: 44.3+/-6.56years old)
      were restored full mouth with a total of 103 adhesively bonded occlusal onlays
      made of lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan,
      Liechtenstein). All restorations were examined during annual recall visits using 
      periodontal parameters according to the modified United States Public Health
      Service (USPHS) criteria: (a) marginal discoloration, (b) secondary caries, (c)
      marginal integrity, (d) surface texture, (e) restoration fracture, and (f)
      occlusal wear, rating with Alpha, Bravo and Charlie over an observation period up
      to 11years (68-139 months; median: 94.9+/-26.1 months). Data was statistically
      analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimation. RESULTS: Monolithic lithium
      disilicate occlusal onlays presented a 100% survival rate. Four restorations
      within one patient (3.9%) presented marginal discoloration, one after 60 and
      three after 108 months (all rated Bravo). One restoration (1%) showed a marginal 
      crack formation (technical complication) after 120 months, rated Bravo. No
      biological complication, debonding or secondary caries could be found and tested 
      periodontal parameters showed excellent results. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the
      analyzed data up to 11years, monolithic occlusal onlays made of lithium
      disilicate ceramic can be considered as a reliable treatment option for
      full-mouth rehabilitations in patients with severe tooth wear.

TI  - Long-term clinical results of chairside Cerec CAD/CAM inlays and onlays: a case
      series.
PG  - 53-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this follow-up study was to examine the performance of 
      Cerec inlays and onlays, all of which were placed by the same clinician, in terms
      of clinical quality over a functional period of 15 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Of 200 Cerec inlays and onlays placed consecutively in a private practice by one 
      of the authors (TO) between 1989 and early 1991, 187 were closely monitored over 
      a period of 15 years. All ceramic inlays and onlays had been placed chairside
      using the Cerec 1 method and had been luted with a bonding composite. Up to 17
      years after their placement, a follow-up assessment was conducted, and the
      restorations were classified using modified United States Public Health Service
      criteria. RESULTS: According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the success rate of Cerec 
      inlays and onlays was 88.7% after 17 years. A total of 21 failures (11%) were
      found in 17 patients. Of these failures, 76% were attributed to ceramic fractures
      (62%) or tooth fractures (14%). The reasons for the remaining failures were
      caries (19%) and endodontic problems (5%). Restorations of premolars presented a 
      lower failure risk than those of molars. CONCLUSION: The survival rate
      probability of 88.7% after up to 17 years of clinical service for Cerec
      computer-aided design/computer-assisted machining restorations made of Vita Mk I 
      feldspathic ceramic is regarded as a very respectable clinical outcome.

TI  - Influence of Different Marginal Forms on Endodontically Treated Posterior Teeth
      Restored with Lithium Disilicate Glass-Ceramic Onlays: Two-Year Follow-up.
PG  - 22-28
LID - 10.11607/ijp.6356 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical performance of endodontically treated (ET)
      teeth restored with two different marginal forms of lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic (LDG ceramic) onlays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120
      posterior teeth were prepared for onlays after ET. The occlusal surfaces of the
      teeth were removed 1.5 to 2 mm anatomically. Different marginal forms were
      employed depending on the thickness of the residual axis wall of each tooth: In
      Group S, a 1-mm shoulder was prepared when the remaining axis wall was > 2 mm (n 
      = 50), and in Group B, a 20- to 30-degree bevel was prepared when the remaining
      axis wall was </= 2 mm (n = 70). The access of the pulp chamber was filled with
      resin, and 1.5 to 2 mm of the box morphology of the pulp chamber was preserved.
      The pressed LDG ceramic was applied to the fabricated onlays. The teeth and
      restorations were checked after 6, 12, and 24 months. All available restored
      teeth were assessed using modified United States Public Health Service criteria. 
      RESULTS: During the observation period, no tooth fracture occurred. Neither tooth
      cracks nor secondary caries were observed in Group S or Group B. The 2-year
      survival rate of the teeth was 100%. Five fractured onlays were observed in Group
      S in the molar region, while all onlays in Group B were intact (P < .05). The
      survival rate of the onlays was 95.83%. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that 
      LDG ceramic onlays can preserve ET posterior teeth with a highly satisfactory
      outcome, though the marginal form may affect the survival rate of the onlay.

TI  - Fracture resistance of compromised endodontically treated teeth restored with
      bonded post and cores: An in vitro study.

LID - S0022-3913(15)00182-1 [pii]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: It is unclear which post and core system performs best when
      bonded to severely compromised endodontically treated teeth. PURPOSE: The purpose
      of this study was to investigate the fracture resistance and mode of failure of
      severely compromised teeth restored with 3 different adhesively bonded post and
      core systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty extracted endodontically treated
      maxillary anterior teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups, CPC, gold cast post
      and core; TPC, titanium prefabricated post/composite resin core; and FPC, quartz 
      fiber reinforced post/composite resin core. All posts were adhesively cemented.
      All cores resembled a central incisor preparation with no remaining tooth
      structure above the finish line. Cast gold crowns were fabricated and cemented
      adhesively. The specimens were aged with thermocycling and cyclic loading. Two
      specimens per group were randomly selected for micro-computed tomographic imaging
      before and after aging. Failure was induced with a universal testing machine. The
      mode of failure was characterized by the interface separation. Data were analyzed
      with 1-way ANOVA (alpha=.05) followed by post hoc tests (Bonferroni). RESULTS: A 
      statistically significant difference was found among the 3 groups (P=.002). CPC
      was significantly different than TPC (P=.008) or FPC (P=.003). The primary mode
      of failure for CPC and TPC was root fracture, and for FPC post debonding.
      CONCLUSIONS: Severely compromised endodontically treated teeth restored with
      bonded gold cast post and cores showed significantly higher fracture resistance.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Endodontically treated teeth are known to have reduced
      structural strength. Glass fiber posts may influence fracture resistance and
      should be evaluated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      influence of glass fiber post length on the fracture resistance of endodontically
      treated teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty intact human maxillary canines were
      selected and divided into 4 groups, the control group consisting of teeth
      restored with a custom gold cast post and core, with a length of two-thirds of
      the root. Other groups received prefabricated glass fiber posts in different
      lengths: group 1/3, removal of one-third of the sealing material (5 mm); group
      1/2, removal of one-half of the sealing material (7.5 mm); and group 2/3, removal
      of two-thirds of the sealing material (10 mm). All the posts were cemented with
      resin cement, and the specimens with glass fiber posts received a composite resin
      core. All the specimens were restored with a metal crown and submitted to a
      compressive load until failure occurred. The results were evaluated by 1-way
      ANOVA, and the all pairwise multiple comparison procedures (Tukey honestly
      significantly difference test) (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The ANOVA showed significant
      differences among the groups (P<.002). The Tukey test showed that the control
      group presented significantly higher resistance to static load than the other
      groups (control group, 634.94 N; group 1/3, 200.01 N; group 1/2, 212.17 N; and
      group 2/3, 236.08 N). Although teeth restored with a cast post and core supported
      a higher compressive load, all of them fractured in a catastrophic manner. For
      teeth restored with glass fiber posts, the failure occurred at the junction
      between the composite resin core and the root. CONCLUSION: The length of glass
      fiber posts did not influence fracture load, but cast post and cores that
      extended two-thirds of the root length had significantly greater fracture
      resistance than glass fiber posts.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The use of resin patterns to produce partial coverage
      restorations is poorly documented. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study
      was to compare the marginal and internal fit accuracy of lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic inlays obtained from wax or resin patterns and fabricated with
      digital and conventional techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A dentoform mandibular
      first molar was prepared for a mesio-occlusal ceramic inlay. Six groups of 15
      inlays were obtained by conventional impression and manual wax (group CICW) or
      resin patterns (group CICR); conventional impression, laboratory scanning of the 
      stone die, CAD-CAM milled wax (group CIDW), or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
      blocks (group CIDR); and scanning of the master preparation with an intraoral
      scanner, CAD-CAM milled wax (group DSDW), or PMMA blocks (DSDR). The same design 
      was applied to produce the wax and PMMA patterns in the last 4 groups. The
      replica technique was used to measure marginal and internal fit under
      stereomicroscopy. Mixed-model ANOVA was applied to assess differences according
      to the techniques, materials, and discrepancy location (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The 
      results demonstrated significant effects of the technique (P<.001), material
      (P=.009), and discrepancy location (P<.001) on fit measurements. Marginal
      discrepancy was only affected by the technique (P<.001), with the digital
      approaches yielding the smallest marginal discrepancy (23.5 +/-3.6 mum), followed
      by the conventional digital techniques (31.1 +/-5.6 mum) and finally by the
      conventional (42.8 +/-7.2 mum) techniques. Internal fit was significantly
      influenced only by the material with lower discrepancy in wax (75.2 +/-9.0 mum)
      than in resin patterns (84.7 +/-15.1 mum). The internal discrepancy was
      significantly larger than the marginal discrepancy in all groups (P<.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Inlays generated from conventional wax and resin patterns tend to
      show higher marginal discrepancies than conventional digital and full digital
      patterns. Wax and resin materials yield similar marginal fit accuracies
      irrespective of the impression/manufacturing technique. Better internal fit was
      shown in wax than in resin patterns, regardless of the technique.

TI  - Computer-aided direct ceramic restorations: a 10-year prospective clinical study 
      of Cerec CAD/CAM inlays and onlays.
PG  - 122-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this follow-up study was to examine the performance of 
      Cerec inlays and onlays in terms of clinical quality over a functional period of 
      10 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 200 Cerec inlays and onlays placed in a
      private practice between 1989 and early 1991, 187 restorations were observed over
      a period of 10 years. The restorations were fabricated chairside using the
      Cerec-1 computer-aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) method and Vita MK I
      feldspathic ceramic. An adhesive technique and luting composite resin were used
      for seating the restorations. After 10 years, the clinical performance of the
      restorations was evaluated using modified USPHS criteria. The results were used
      to classify success and failure. RESULTS: According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the
      success rate of Cerec inlays and onlays dropped to 90.4% after 10 years. A total 
      of 15 (8%) failures were found in 11 patients. Of these failures, 73% were caused
      by either ceramic fractures (53%) or tooth fractures (20%). The reasons for the
      remaining failures were caries (20%) and endodontic problems (7%). The
      three-surface Cerec reconstructions were found to have the most failures.
      CONCLUSION: The failure rate of 8% and the drop of the survival probability rate 
      to 90.4% after 10 years of clinical service of Cerec-1 CAD/CAM restorations made 
      of Vita MK I feldspathic ceramic appear to be acceptable in private practice.
      This is particularly true in light of the very high patient satisfaction.

TI  - Survival of Cast Gold and Ceramic Onlays Placed in a School of Dentistry: A
      Retrospective Study.
PG  - 693-698
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13233 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was done to compare the survival rates of cast gold and
      ceramic onlays placed in a dental school setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An
      electronic search was conducted in the patient records at Adams School of
      Dentistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for onlay codes that were 
      in the database (From 1998 until 2018). Progress notes and radiographs were
      scrutinized to establish the survival time of the restorations. Any complications
      that occurred during the life time of the restorations were noted. The survival
      was summarized by categorization based on ranges of survival time in years; group
      1: 1 to 5 years, group 2: 6 to 22 years. The mean survival time and standard
      deviation were calculated. One-way ANOVA was used to determine whether there was 
      a statistically significant difference in the survival times between gold and
      ceramic onlays. RESULTS: The mean survival rate of cast gold onlays (86.6%) was
      comparable to that of ceramic onlays (81.1%). The gold onlays in Group 1 had a
      higher mean survival time (2.43 years) than the ceramic onlays (2.03 years). This
      difference was statistically significant (p = 0.002). The ceramic onlays in Group
      2 had a mean survival time of 19.75 years while gold onlays had a mean survival
      time of 17.63 years. This difference was not statistically significant (p =
      0.91). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that while the survival rate of ceramic
      onlays (81.1%) was inferior to that of cast gold onlays (86.6%), it was
      comparable.

      canines restored with fiber posts and metal-ceramic or all-ceramic crowns.
PG  - 384-7
LID - 10.11607/ijp.3409 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the fracture strength of
      endodontically treated canines restored with glass-fiber posts (GFPs) and either 
      metal-ceramic (MC) or all-ceramic (AC) crowns in the presence or absence of 2 mm 
      of ferrule height. Fifty human maxillary canines were endodontically treated and 
      randomly divided into five groups of 10 specimens each. The first group remained 
      intact (control), while the remainder were restored with GFPs and composite cores
      with either MC or AC crowns. Each of the AC and MC groups was equally divided
      between teeth with or without ferrule. Teeth were embedded in acrylic resin and
      loaded at a 135-degree angle to their long axis until fracture. Fracture strength
      was not significantly different between ferrule and no ferrule groups (P = .571),
      but was significantly larger for the MC groups compared with the control and AC
      groups (P = .009 and P = .024, respectively). A significant effect of the type of
      restoration was found as teeth restored with MC crowns presented significantly
      higher fracture strength, independently of ferrule.

TI  - A randomized, prospective, open-ended clinical trial of zirconia fixed partial
      dentures on teeth and implants: interim results.
PG  - 221-31
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to compare the 
      outcomes of zirconia crowns and fixed partial dentures (FPDs) supported by teeth 
      or implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited based on
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 59 eligible subjects were assigned randomly to 
      treatment by one of four zirconia systems (Cercon, ZirkonZahn, Lava, and Katana).
      One hundred seven single-tooth and 160 three- to six-unit FPDs were fabricated on
      teeth and implants and cemented using composite resin cement. Californian Dental 
      Association (CDA) quality evaluation, Plaque Index, and Gingival Index scores
      were recorded, and radiographic assessment of the restorations was performed
      using periapical and panoramic radiographs at baseline and annually up to 4
      years. RESULTS: Five failures (1.9%) were recorded. The 4-year Kaplan-Meier
      survival probabilities of FPDs were higher than those of single-tooth
      restorations (P = .046). The highest survival probability for crowns was observed
      for Katana and the lowest for Cercon (P < .05). For FPDs, the survival
      probabilities of Lava restorations were similar to those of Cercon but lower than
      those of ZirkonZahn and Katana (P < .05). The 4-year survival probabilities of
      implant- and tooth-supported crowns were comparable (P = .182). Regarding CDA
      ratings, the slight marginal discrepancy scores for the Cercon restorations were 
      higher than for the other systems at 1 year (P < .05). In FPDs, 94.5% of Katana
      FPDs had slight or gross color mismatch scores, and the difference between color 
      and surface ratings among zirconia systems was significant (P < .05). FPDs had
      better periodontal scores than crowns over the 4-year observation period (P <
      .05). CONCLUSION: The 4-year interim results of this study suggest that zirconia 
      systems used to fabricate FPDs have predictably high survival rates on teeth and 
      implants and may exhibit differences, particularly in terms of mechanical
      failures, marginal adaptation, and color matching.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence that
      resin composite and porcelain veneer restorations, associated or not to fiber
      post placement, have on fracture resistance and deflection of pulpless anterior
      teeth. METHODS: One hundred twenty freshly extracted human maxillary central
      incisors were selected. Teeth were randomly divided into 7 experimental groups
      (veneer preparation/resin composite veneer placement/endodontic therapy and resin
      composite veneer placement/endodontic therapy, fiber post and resin composite
      veneer placement/porcelain veneer placement/endodontic therapy and porcelain
      veneer placement/endodontic therapy, fiber post and porcelain veneer placement)
      and a control group (n = 15). Specimens were loaded to fracture recording crown
      deflection, and data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Veneer preparations
      did not significantly influence fracture resistance of incisors. On the contrary,
      veneer preparation significantly increased specimen deflection values. Fiber
      posts seemed to significantly increase mean maximum load values for
      endodontically treated teeth restored with either composite or porcelain veneers.
      CONCLUSIONS: A fiber post restoration can be suggested when endodontic treatment 
      is associated with veneer restoration. Veneer restorations seem to be an optimal 
      choice also for endodontically treated teeth.

TI  - In vitro Evaluation of the Marginal Fit and Internal Adaptation of Zirconia and
      Lithium Disilicate Single Crowns: Micro-CT Comparison Between Different
      Manufacturing Procedures.
PG  - 160-172
LID - 10.2174/1874210601812010160 [doi]
AB  - Background: Prosthetic precision can be affected by several variables, such as
      restorative materials, manufacturing procedures, framework design, cementation
      techniques and aging. Marginal adaptation is critical for long-term longevity and
      clinical success of dental restorations. Marginal misfit may lead to cement
      exposure to oral fluids, resulting in microleakage and cement dissolution. As a
      consequence, marginal discrepancies enhance percolation of bacteria, food and
      oral debris, potentially causing secondary caries, endodontic inflammation and
      periodontal disease. Objective: The aim of the present in vitro study was to
      evaluate the marginal and internal adaptation of zirconia and lithium disilicate 
      single crowns, produced with different manufacturing procedures. Methods:
      Forty-five intact human maxillary premolars were prepared for single crowns by
      means of standardized preparations. All-ceramic crowns were fabricated with
      either CAD-CAM or heat-pressing procedures (CAD-CAM zirconia, CAD-CAM lithium
      disilicate, heat-pressed lithium disilicate) and cemented onto the teeth with a
      universal resin cement. Non-destructive micro-CT scanning was used to achieve the
      marginal and internal gaps in the coronal and sagittal planes; then, precision of
      fit measurements were calculated in a dedicated software and the results were
      statistically analyzed. Results: The heat-pressed lithium disilicate crowns were 
      significantly less accurate at the prosthetic margins (p<0.05) while they
      performed better at the occlusal surface (p<0.05). No significant differences
      were noticed between CAD-CAM zirconia and lithium disilicate crowns (p>0.05);
      nevertheless CAD-CAM zirconia copings presented the best marginal fit among the
      experimental groups. As to the thickness of the cement layer, reduced amounts of 
      luting agent were noticed at the finishing line, whereas a thicker layer was
      reported at the occlusal level. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the present
      in vitro investigation, the following conclusions can be drawn: the recorded
      marginal gaps were within the clinical acceptability irrespective of both the
      restorative material and the manufacturing procedures; the CAD-CAM processing
      techniques for both zirconia and lithium disilicate produced more consistent
      marginal gaps than the heat-pressing procedures; the tested universal resin
      cement can be safely used with both restorative materials.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of ferrule height
      and post length on fracture resistance and failure mode of endodontically treated
      teeth restored with glass fibre posts, composite resin cores and crowns. Ninety
      human maxillary central incisors were endodontically treated and divided into
      three groups (n = 30) according to the ferrule heights: 4, 2 and 0 mm,
      respectively. Post spaces in each group were prepared at 2/3, 1/2 and 1/3 of the 
      root length (n = 10). The specimens were received fibre posts, composite resin
      core build up and cast metal crowns. After thermocycling, compressive static load
      was applied at an angle of 135 degrees to the crowns. Two-way analysis of
      variance showed significant differences in the failure load in the ferrule height
      groups, no significant differences in post length groups and no significant
      interaction between ferrule heights and post lengths. More restorable failure
      modes were observed.

      Restorations for Nonvital Teeth.
PG  - 457-62
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12279 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare all ceramic inlay/onlay survival
      rates in vital and nonvital teeth having the same cavity design. Filling the pulp
      chamber with ceramic materials or not was also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Ceramic class II inlays/onlays were made on 11 premolars and 30 molars: 14 vital,
      27 endodontically treated. The same tooth preparation design was performed on
      vital and nonvital teeth: In nonvital teeth the pulp chambers were covered by a
      glass ionomer cement until the pulpal floor depths were between 2 and 2.5 mm,
      more likely similar to the vital teeth preparations. In vital teeth, glass
      ionomer was used as a liner to achieve pulpal floor depths between 2 and 2.5 mm
      when needed. The restorations were assessed (at baseline, 6 months, 1 and 2
      years) according to three criteria: marginal discoloration, marginal integrity,
      and fracture of teeth/restorations, consistent with United States Public Health
      Service (USPHS) criteria. RESULTS: Eight teeth (19%) showed minor marginal
      discolorations, while three molars (7%) had loss of marginal integrity. These
      margins were adjusted using rubber polishing cups and were then judged clinically
      acceptable. From these three molars, one was vital and two were endodontically
      treated. No fracture of teeth or restorations was observed. Chi square and exact 
      probability tests were used. There was no statistical difference between vital
      and nonvital teeth (p = 0.719 chi-squared and Fisher) or between premolars and
      molars (p = 0.564 chi-squared; 1.000, Fisher). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations
      of this study there was no difference for the same inlay/onlay cavity design
      between vital and nonvital teeth. In nonvital teeth, it seems that filling the
      pulp chamber with a ceramic core material is not important. Long-term observation
      periods are needed to reinforce the clinical behavior outcome.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Polymer-based composite materials have been proposed as an
      alternative for single unit restorations, due to their resilient and shock
      absorbing behavior, in contrast to the brittleness of ceramic materials that
      could result in failure by fracture. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the fatigue strength 
      and damage modes of monolithic posterior resin nanoceramic and lithium disilicate
      glass ceramic crowns. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-six resin nanoceramic (RNC) and lithium
      disilicate glass ceramic (LD) 2 mm monolithic crowns (n=13) were cemented on
      composite resin replicas of a prepared tooth and subjected to cyclic load with
      lithium disilicate indenters for 2 million cycles. Specimens and indenters were
      inspected every 500,000 cycles and suspended when presenting fractures or
      debonding. Surviving specimens were embedded in epoxy resin, polished and
      subsurface damage was analyzed. Specimens presenting fractures or severe
      subsurface damage were considered as failures. Survival data was subjected to
      Fisher's exact test; damage modes were subjected to Mann-Whitney test (p<0.05).
      RESULTS: There were no debonding, cohesive or catastrophic failures. Considering 
      subsurface damage, 53.8% of RNC and 46.2% of LD crowns survived the fatigue test,
      presenting no statistical difference. Chief damage modes were radial cracks for
      RNC and inner cone cracks for LD, presenting no statistical difference.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that if debonding issues can be resolved, resin 
      nanoceramic figures can be an alternative to posterior crowns. Although distinct,
      damage modes revealed potential to cause bulk fracture in both glass ceramic and 
      resin nanoceramic crowns.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: For posterior partial restorations an overlap of indication exists
      where either ceramic or resin-based composite materials can be successfully
      applied. The aim of this study was to compare the fatigue resistance of modern
      dental ceramic materials versus dental resin composites in order to address such 
      conflicts. METHODS: Bar specimens of five ceramic materials and resin composites 
      were produced according to ISO 4049 and stored for 14 days in distilled water at 
      37 degrees C. The following ceramic materials were selected for testing: a
      high-strength zirconium dioxide (e.max ZirCAD, Ivoclar), a machinable lithium
      disilicate (e.max CAD, Ivoclar), a pressable lithium disilicate ceramic (e-max
      Press, Ivoclar), a fluorapatite-based glass-ceramic (e.max Ceram, Ivoclar), and a
      machinable color-graded feldspathic porcelain (Trilux Forte, Vita). The composite
      materials selected were: an indirect machinable composite (Lava Ultimate, 3M
      ESPE) and four direct composites with varying filler nature (Clearfil Majesty
      Posterior, Kuraray; GrandioSO, Voco; Tetric EvoCeram, Ivoclar-Vivadent; and
      CeramX Duo, Dentsply). Fifteen specimens were tested in water for initial
      strength (sigmain) in 4-point bending. Using the same test set-up, the residual
      flexural fatigue strength (sigmaff) was determined using the staircase approach
      after 10(4) cycles at 0.5 Hz (n=25). Weibull parameters sigma0 and m were
      calculated for the sigmain specimens, whereas the sigmaff and strength loss in
      percentage were obtained from the fatigue experiment. RESULTS: The zirconium
      oxide ceramic showed the highest sigmain and sigmaff (768 and 440 MPa,
      respectively). Although both lithium disilicate ceramics were similar in the
      static test, the pressable version showed a significantly higher fatigue
      resistance after cyclic loading. Both the fluorapatite-based and the feldspathic 
      porcelain showed equivalent initial and cyclic fatigue properties. From the
      composites, the highest filled direct material Clearfil Majesty Posterior showed 
      superior fatigue performance. From all materials, e.max Press and Clearfil
      Majesty Posterior showed the lowest strength loss (29.6% and 32%, respectively), 
      whereas the other materials lost between 41% and 62% of their flexural strength
      after cyclic loading. CONCLUSIONS: Dental ceramics and resin composite materials 
      show equivalent fatigue strength degradation at loads around 0.5sigmain values.
      Apart from the zirconium oxide and the lithium disilicate ceramics, resin
      composites generally showed better sigmaff after 10,000 cycles than the
      fluorapatite glass-ceramic and the feldspathic porcelain. Resin composite
      restorations may be used as an equivalent alternative to glass-rich-ceramic
      inlays regarding mechanical performance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study was conducted to assess the marginal adaptation
      and fracture resistance of computer aided design/computer aided manufacturer
      (CAD-CAM) fabricated endocrowns restoring endodontically treated molars using
      different machinable blocks with thermomechanical loading protocols. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Devitalized mandibular molars were prepared in a standardized way
      and divided into 4 groups (n = 10) to receive CAD/CAM fabricated endocrowns using
      four materials (Lithium disilicate ceramics, polymer infiltrated ceramics,
      zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramics and resin nanoceramics. Marginal
      gaps (microm) were measured using stereomicroscope before cementation and after
      cementation. After thermomechanical aging, marginal gap measurements were
      repeated, and then fracture resistance test was performed. Two-way analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD multiple comparisons were used to assess the
      effect of material on the marginal gap before, after cementation, and after
      thermomechanical aging. One Way ANOVA was used to assess the effect of material
      on the fracture resistance. RESULTS: The difference between marginal gaps values 
      of the tested materials was statistically insignificant but with significant
      increase after cementation and after thermomechanical aging. Cerasmart endocrowns
      showed the highest mean fracture load value (1508.5 +/- 421.7N) with
      statistically significant difference than Vita Enamic endocrowns and Celtra Duo. 
      CONCLUSION: The tested materials showed marginal vertical gap readings within the
      limits of clinically acceptable standards. Resin nanoceramics and lithium
      disilicate showed the highest values of fracture resistance followed by polymer
      infiltrated ceramics favoring their use for endocrown restorations. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanical behavior of ceramic materials varies with the
      variation of their structure and mechanical properties. Accordingly, further
      investigation is always needed to explore the biomechanical behavior of recent
      materials when used as endocrowns before clinical trials.

TI  - Do anterior and posterior teeth treated with post-and-core restorations have
      similar failure rates? A systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The association between tooth type, location in the dental 
      arch, and selection of a post-and-core system for endodontically treated teeth is
      unclear. Information on the influence of these parameters on the failure rate of 
      teeth treated with post-and-core restorations is needed. PURPOSE: The purpose of 
      this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the available evidence on 
      the failure rates of anterior and posterior teeth treated with post-and-core
      restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web
      of Science, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database,
      Brazilian Library in Dentistry, Cochrane Library, and Gray literature for
      randomized clinical trials comparing the failure rates of anterior and posterior 
      teeth treated with post-and-core restorations. The risk of bias tool from the
      Cochrane Collaboration was used for quality assessment of the studies. RESULTS:
      The search strategy identified 2526 articles, and 6 studies were included in the 
      meta-analysis. No difference in the failure rate of post-and-core restorations
      placed in anterior and posterior teeth was found in most studies. The risk ratio 
      for anterior versus posterior teeth was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.69-1.64; P=.79). The risk ratio for incisors versus canines was 3.08 (95% CI,
      0.56-17.04; P=.20) and that for premolars versus molars was 0.45 (95% CI,
      0.12-1.74; P=.25). The risk ratio for prefabricated glass fiber posts on anterior
      versus posterior teeth was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.61-2.09; P=.70) and that for metal
      posts was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.64-1.91; P=.72). CONCLUSIONS: The failure rates in
      anterior and posterior teeth treated with post-and-core restorations were similar
      at short- to medium-term follow-up. More well-designed clinical trials comparing 
      the survival and failure rates of anterior and posterior teeth treated with
      post-and-core restorations with longer follow-up times are needed.

TI  - Clinical performance of monolithic CAD/CAM tooth-supported zirconia restorations:
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.2186/jpr.JPR_D_21_00081 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the survival rate,
      biological complications, technical complications, and clinical behavior of
      single crowns supported by teeth made up in monolithic zirconia with CAD/CAM
      technology. STUDY SELECTION: An extensive electronic search was conducted through
      Medline/PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Additional manual search 
      was performed on the references of included articles to identify relevant
      publications. Two reviewers independently performed the selection and electronic 
      and manual search. RESULTS: From nine articles included, there was a total of 594
      participants and 1657 single-tooth restorations with a mean exposure time of 1.07
      years, and follow-up period between 0.3 and 2.1 years. All studies showed a
      moderate level of quality, with a consequent moderate possibility of associated
      bias, using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with survival rate (SR) ranging
      between 91% to 100%. Bleeding on probing (BOP) were reported with an average
      value of 29.12%. Marginal integrity showed high success rate values for the
      observation periods, except for one that included patients with bruxism which
      obtained a SR of 31.60%. Failures and/or fractures, mostly total and requiring
      replacement, were observed in three studies. Linear regression showed that there 
      was no statistical correlation between survival rate and type of cementation and 
      the average years of follow-up (p=0.730 e p=0.454). There was high heterogeneity 
      between studies (I2 = 93.74% and Q = 79.672). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitation 
      of this study, monolithic zirconia might be considered as a possible option for
      restoring single crowns, especially in the posterior zone.

TI  - Effect of fiber post and cusp coverage on fracture resistance of endodontically
      treated maxillary premolars directly restored with composite resin.
PG  - 1428-32
LID - 10.1016/j.joen.2009.07.010 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are different reinforcement methods in restoring root-filled 
      teeth. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of fiber post
      and cusp coverage on fracture resistance of endodontically treated maxillary
      premolars directly restored with composite resin. METHODS: Seventy-five maxillary
      premolars were divided into 5 groups (n = 15). Except for the control group
      (intact teeth), in other groups mesio-occlusodistal (MOD) cavities were prepared 
      after endodontic treatment. In the groups with cusp coverage, both buccal and
      lingual cusps were reduced up to 2 mm. Then specimens in the experimental groups 
      were prepared as follows: composite resin restoration without post and cusp
      capping, composite resin restoration without post but with cusp capping,
      composite resin restoration with post but without cusp capping, and composite
      resin restoration with post and cusp capping. After finishing and polishing, the 
      specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for a week. Subsequent
      to thermocycling and exertion of compressive forces parallel to the long axes of 
      the teeth at a strain rate of 2 mm/min, data were analyzed by using one-way
      analysis of variance and chi(2) test. RESULTS: There were no significant
      differences in fracture resistance between the groups (P = .057). However, chi(2)
      test showed statistically significant differences between the groups in failure
      mode (P < .001). The highest number of favorable fractures was observed in the
      control group (intact teeth). CONCLUSIONS: Root-filled maxillary premolars,
      restored with direct resin composite with or without fiber post and cusp capping,
      had similar fracture resistance under static loading.

TI  - Marginal and internal fit of CAD-CAM inlay/onlay restorations: A systematic
      review of in vitro studies.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Different parameters can influence the adaptation of
      computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM)
      inlay/onlay restorations. However, systematic reviews to identify and discuss
      these parameters are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was 
      to summarize the scienti fi c literature investigating all parameters that can
      influence both the marginal and internal adaptation of CAD-CAM inlay/onlay
      restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search was conducted by 2
      independent reviewers for studies published in English between January 1, 2007
      and September 20, 2017 on the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science
      databases and in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Factors investigated in the
      selected articles included the type of CAD-CAM system, virtual space parameters, 
      version of the software, type of block, luting procedure, type of restoration,
      sample size and aging procedure, evaluation method, and number of measurement
      points per specimen. RESULTS: A total of 162 articles were identi fi ed, of which
      23 articles met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies investigated adaptation with
      different restorative materials, 2 evaluated adaptation according to the type of 
      preparation design, 9 compared adaptation before/after thermomechanical loading, 
      and 2 before/after cementation, 1 study investigated marginal adaptation based on
      whether the optical scan was made intraorally or extraorally, 1 compared
      adaptation with 5 and 3 axis CAM systems, and 1 assessed adaptation with 4
      different intraoral scanners. The risk of bias was high for 7, medium for 15, and
      low for 1 of the studies reviewed. The high level of heterogeneity across the
      studies excluded meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies reported
      clinically acceptable values for marginal adaptation. The performance of a
      CAD-CAM system is influenced by the type of restorative material. A nonretentive 
      cavity preparation exhibited better adaptation than a retentive preparation. Most
      studies showed that thermomechanical loading affected the quality of marginal
      adaptation. Cementation increased marginal discrepancies. No statistically
      significant difference was found for marginal fit of onlays between intraoral and
      extraoral optical scans using a stone die. The number of milling axes, the type
      of digital camera, and the region measured were statistically significant in
      relation to marginal/internal adaptation. Values of adaptation recorded failed to
      reproduce the preestablished spacer parameters in the software. Clarification is 
      needed concerning adaptation according to the type of preparation design, the
      type of material, the choice of intrinsic parameters for the CAD process, the
      type and shape of milling instruments, and the behavior of the material during
      milling. Adaptation of CAD-CAM inlay/onlays should be evaluated under clinical
      conditions.

TI  - Mechanical stability of zirconia meso-abutments bonded to titanium bases restored
      with different monolithic all-ceramic crowns.
PG  - 1091-1097
LID - 10.11607/jomi.7431 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the bending moments and failure modes of zirconia
      meso-abutments bonded to titanium bases restored with different monolithic
      all-ceramic crowns after aging, and to compare them to titanium abutments
      restored with all-ceramic crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight internal
      conical connection implants (Conelog, Camlog 4.3 mm diameter) were restored with 
      four different computer-aided design/computed-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)
      abutment-crown combinations (n = 12). Thirty-six customized zirconia
      meso-abutments were bonded to titanium bases (Conelog Titanium Base CAD/CAM
      crown, Camlog) and divided into three groups according to the different crown
      materials: (T1) monolithic lithium-disilicate (e-max CAD, Ivoclar), (T2)
      monolithic PICN (polymer-infiltrated ceramic network [Enamic, Vita]), and (T3)
      monolithic zirconia (Lava Plus, 3M ESPE). Twelve titanium customized abutments
      restored with monolithic lithium-disilicate (e-max CAD, Ivoclar) crowns served as
      the control group (C). The crowns were equal maxillary central incisors and were 
      adhesively bonded with a resin-based cement (Panavia 21, Kuraray). All samples
      were embedded in acrylic holders. After aging (1,200,000 cycles, 49 N, 1.67 Hz, 5
      degrees C to 50 degrees C, 120 seconds), static load was applied until failure.
      Bending moments were calculated for comparison of the groups. Data were
      statistically treated with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey
      post hoc test (P < .05). Failure modes were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: The 
      means of the bending moments were 356.4 +/- 20.8 Ncm (T1), 357.7 +/- 26.3 Ncm
      (T2), 385.5 +/- 21.2 Ncm (T3), and 358.8 +/- 25.3 Ncm (C). Group T3 revealed
      significantly higher mean bending moments than the other groups (P < .05). No
      differences were found between zirconia meso-abutments supported by titanium
      bases and customized titanium abutments when lithium-disilicate crowns were used 
      (P > .05). No failures were identified during and after aging. After static load,
      failures occurred due to fracture of the abutment in the internal connection in
      all the groups. CONCLUSION: Zirconia meso-abutments bonded to titanium bases
      showed similar mechanical stability compared with customized titanium abutments. 
      Regarding the crown material, all three tested ceramics (lithium-disilicate,
      PICN, and zirconia) revealed very good stability when used in the monolithic
      state.

TI  - In Vitro Assessment of Retention and Resistance Failure Loads of Teeth Restored
      with a Complete Coverage Restoration and Different Core Materials.
PG  - e229-e236
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12668 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate in vitro the retention and the resistance form, as well
      as the failure modes of maxillary premolars restored with cast metal crowns and
      different core materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty human extracted maxillary 
      premolars were selected according to their size and were embedded in PMMA resin
      blocks. After removing a part of their clinical crowns, the teeth were randomly
      divided into 3 groups of 20 teeth and were either left unrestored, or they were
      restored with amalgam or composite resin. All teeth were prepared for a cast
      metal complete coverage restoration. The restorations were cemented on the
      prepared teeth with a resin-modified glass ionomer luting agent (GC Fuji Plus).
      All specimens were subjected to static loading at 1 mm/min by a universal testing
      machine, until failure. Half the specimens of each group were subjected to
      tensile loading along the long axis of the teeth. The other half were subjected
      to compressive loading at a 30 degrees angle. Failure loads and failure modes for
      each tooth were recorded. The statistical analysis included descriptive
      statistics, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's HSD test. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed 
      statistically significant differences among the 3 tested groups (p < 0.05) for
      both tests. The group of teeth with no core material presented the highest
      failure loads for both the tensile and the compressive loading tests, with mean
      loads of 381.02 Nu and 741.21 Nu, respectively. Mean tensile and compressive
      failure loads for the amalgam group were 277.34 Nu and 584.75 Nu, while the
      composite resin group presented the lowest tensile and compressive failure
      values, which were 250.77 Nu and 465.78 Nu, respectively. The compression loading
      test resulted in the same failure mode for all specimens, which included
      unfavorable fracture of the teeth in combination with detachment of the cast
      metal complete coverage restorations. The tensile loading test resulted in
      different failure modes between the groups that used a core material and the
      group with no core material. CONCLUSIONS: Teeth that lost more than half of their
      coronal structure presented better retention and resistance form if no core
      material was used, provided that a minimum of 2-mm axial wall height was present 
      at the missing part. Teeth that have lost more than half of their coronal
      structure and were restored with amalgam core presented better retention and
      resistance form than those restored with composite resin. Catastrophic fractures,
      extending to the root, were associated with compression forces but not with
      tensile forces.

      ceramic fixed partial dentures.
PG  - 395-402
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12568 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the 3-year survival and success rates of monolithic (M) and
      partially veneered (PV) zirconia-fixed partial dentures (FPDs). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Sixty-seven FPDs (n = 33 M-FPDs; n = 34 PV-FPDs) were placed in 51
      patients (n = 23 males; mean age 61.5 years) and clinically followed up 1 week, 6
      months, and then yearly after placement. One hundred per cent (100%) of M-FPDs
      and 70% of PV-FPDs were located in the posterior region. Ninety-two per cent
      (92%) of M-FPDs had three units, whereas 50% of PV-FPDs had more than three
      units. A facial veneer was present in 73% of the PV-FPDs units. Survival and
      success were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the
      log-rank test (alpha = .05). RESULTS: The mean observation period was 3.5 years
      for M-FPDs and 3.1 years for PV-FPDs. Most complications associated with FPDs
      were biological in nature. Ceramic defects occurred exclusively among PV-FPDs.
      Three-year survival was 96.7% for M-FPDs and 93.8% for PV-FPDs (P = .064).
      Three-year success was 93.8% for M-FPDs and 81.7% for PV-FPDs (P = .039).
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of both M-FPDs and PV-FPDs yielded clinically successful
      results over a mean period of 3 years. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: By using monolithic
      or facially veneered zirconia, ceramic FPDs could be fabricated which showed only
      a minimum of technical complications over the period of investigation without
      sacrificing adequate esthetics.

TI  - Marginal and Internal Adaptation of Lithium Disilicate Endocrowns Fabricated By
      Heat-Pressable and Subtractive Techniques.
PG  - 509-514
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13272 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate and to compare the marginal and the internal fit of milled
      (MLE) and heat-pressed lithium disilicate endocrowns (PLE). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Thirty mandibular molars were prepared following the circumferential
      butt margin endocrown preparations; the cervical margin is parallel to the
      occlusal surface without ferrule design. A digital scan of molars was made using 
      an intraoral digital scanner. The samples were separated into two groups (n = 15 
      per group); MLE: endocrowns were milled using LDS blocks and a 5-axis milling
      machine, PLE: endocrowns were heat-pressed using lost wax technique and LDS
      ingots. Marginal and internal adaptation were assessed using a replica technique 
      and a stereomicroscope, selecting 32 measurements on each endocrown. Data were
      analyzed with one-way repeated measures ANOVA, two-way repeated measures ANOVA,
      student's t-test and paired student t-test (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: Statistically
      significant interactions were recorded between fabrication technique and region
      (p < 0.05), F (1.97, 27.69) = 5.462. Group MLE displayed significantly smaller
      gaps than PLE in all regions (p < 0.001). The largest gap was observed at the
      pulpal floor in both groups. The internal gap was significantly larger than the
      marginal gap in MLE group (p < 0.001), while no statistically significant
      difference was observed in PLE group (p = 0.082). CONCLUSION: Heat-pressed and
      milled lithium disilicate endocrowns are clinically suitable, but the milled
      technique displayed a better fit than heat-pressed technique when marginal and
      internal adaptation were examined.

PG  - 71-9
LID - 10.2341/10-355-L [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The load capability of post-restored endodontically treated teeth
      (ETT) can be determined at different restorative stages. It was the aim of this
      study to compare the load capability of ETT at these stages. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Maxillary central incisors were divided into 4 groups (n=10) and
      endodontically treated. Specimens were restored with: (I) only glass fiber posts 
      (GFP); (II) GFP and composite build-up with 2 mm ferrule; (III and IV) with
      additional adhesively luted all-ceramic crowns. Group (I) to (III) were
      statically loaded, and group (IV) was exposed to thermomechanical loading (TML)
      and subsequent static loading. RESULTS: The lowest median load level of 73 N was 
      determined for group (I). The maximum median load value of 331 N was found for
      group (III). The comparison of Fmax [N] of group (I), (II) and (III) revealed
      significant differences between the groups (p<0.001). The specimens of group (IV)
      failed at significantly lower load values (p<0.005) as similarly restored
      specimens of group (III) which were only statically loaded. The stage of
      restoration and TML loading prior to static loading had a significant impact on
      fracture patterns (p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Every additional restorative step
      torwards a final crown-restored ETT significantly increased the load capability. 
      TML prior to load-to-fracture testing of the complete restorative complex, ie.
      post, core and crown, significantly decreased maximum load capability.

TI  - Comparison of in vitro fracture strength of metallic and tooth-coloured posts and
      cores.
PG  - 595-601
AB  - In root-treated anterior teeth a better aesthetic can be achieved by using
      translucent and tooth-coloured post and core restorations instead of traditional 
      metal post systems. The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the fracture
      strength of tooth-coloured ceramic and fibre-reinforced posts as well as titanium
      posts with clinically proven gold alloy posts as a control. Two all-ceramic, one 
      gold alloy and three combined post restoration systems (titanium and ceramic,
      respectively, fibre-reinforced posts with composite core) were each applied to
      upper incisors and after thermal cycling and mechanical loading (TCML) the
      fracture strength was determined. The variant providing the most reliable
      fracture strength values and the experimental fibre-reinforced composite (FRC)
      posts were - in combination with adhesively luted crowns - used to determine the 
      fracture strength of the restoration after thermal cycling and mechanical
      loading. The median fracture strength of the luted posts and cores fluctuated
      between 114 and 546 N. Posts with composite cores demonstrate a higher fracture
      strength in comparison to the all-ceramic and gold alloy systems. Typical failure
      of metal systems was marked by loosening of the bonding and pulling out of the
      post in contrast to fracture of the ceramic posts. After the application of the
      crowns the ceramic system with composite core provided a fracture strength of 338
      N and the FRC system a fracture strength of 228 N. Regarding fracture strength,
      the ceramic posts with composite cores are an alternative to commonly used gold
      posts and cores. A standardized technical manufacture of FRC posts and cores
      would provide better fracture strength results of this new dental material. Post 
      and core restorations with tooth-coloured, translucent material offer an improved
      aesthetic especially in anterior restorations. Because of the high fracture
      strength prefabricated ceramic posts in combination with composite cores should
      prove their clinical applicability.

TI  - Resistance to fracture of endodontically treated teeth restored with different
      post systems.
PG  - 431-7
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Very little is known about the resistance to fracture of
      endodontically treated teeth restored with newly developed esthetic post systems.
      Purpose. This in vitro study compared the effect of 1 titanium and 3 esthetic
      post systems on the fracture resistance and fracture patterns of crowned,
      endodontically treated teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 recently
      extracted human maxillary canines with their crowns removed were endodontically
      treated. Four groups of 10 specimens were formed. Teeth were restored with
      titanium, quartz fiber, glass fiber, and zirconia posts and numbered as groups 1,
      2, 3, and 4, respectively. All posts were cemented with Single Bond dental
      adhesive system and dual-polymerizing RelyX ARC adhesive resin cement. All teeth 
      were restored with composite cores, and metal crowns were fabricated and cemented
      with glass ionomer cement. Each specimen was embedded in acrylic resin and then
      secured in a universal load-testing machine. A compressive load was applied at a 
      130-degree angle to the long axis of the tooth until fracture, at a crosshead
      speed of 1 mm/min. One-way analysis of variance and a Tukey test were used to
      determine the significance of the failure loads between groups (P<.001). A
      non-parametric chi(2) test was conducted for evaluation of the mode of failure
      (P<.001). RESULTS: The mean failure loads (kg) were 66.95, 91.20, 75.90, and
      78.91 for groups 1 to 4, respectively. Teeth restored with quartz fiber posts
      (group 2) exhibited significantly higher resistance to fracture (P<.001) than the
      other 3 groups. Teeth restored with glass fiber and zirconia posts (groups 3 and 
      4) were statistically similar (P>.05). Fractures that would allow repair of the
      tooth were observed in groups 2 and 3, whereas unrestorable, catastrophic
      fractures were observed in groups 1 and 4 (P<.001). CONCLUSION: Within the
      limitations of this study, significantly higher failure loads were recorded for
      root canal treated teeth restored with quartz fiber posts. Fractures that would
      allow repeated repair were observed in teeth restored with quartz fiber and glass
      fiber posts.

TI  - Clinical performance of bonded ceramic inlays/onlays: A 5- to 18-year
      retrospective longitudinal study.
PG  - 187-192
AB  - PURPOSE: This retrospective longitudinal study evaluated the clinical performance
      of bonded ceramic inlays/onlays, placed by the first author in his private
      practice, in a 5 to 18-year period. METHODS: The patients evaluated had been
      treated in the office for at least 7 years and were still in the practice up to
      year 2013. 130 randomly selected patients agreed to participate in the study. 93 
      bonded ceramic inlays/onlays (BCRs), were placed on posterior teeth in 47
      subjects. Gender, age, tooth preparation, number, type, extent, location, quality
      and survival of the restorations, ceramic materials, luting resins cements,
      parafunctional habits, secondary caries and maintenance therapy were the
      variables evaluated. Cohen 's Kappa coefficient, on the quality analysis of the
      restorations, ranged from 0.78 to 1. Fisher 's exact test, Chi Square test,
      Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney non-parametric test were indicated to
      analyze significant differences. RESULTS: At the initial examination, 87 (93.5%) 
      restorations were in function and six failed (6.5%). 81 (93%) were rated as
      clinical successes. The observed mean survival time of those that remained
      functional was 11 years. The standard deviation was 4 years, with a 95% CI for
      the overall observed mean survival time (10 years-11 years, 9 months). 87 of 93
      BCRs had a functional success of 93.5%, with an observed mean survival of 11
      years. The clinical performance of bonded ceramic onlays was very acceptable.
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Bonded ceramic onlays showed a predictable, esthetic, and 
      functional treatment, with acceptable longevity.

TI  - Fiber-reinforced resin coating for endocrown preparations: a technical report.
PG  - 242-8
LID - 10.2341/12-139-TR [doi]
AB  - Coronal rehabilitation of endodontically treated posterior teeth is still a
      controversial issue. Although the use of classical crowns supported by radicular 
      metal posts remains widespread in dentistry, their invasiveness has been largely 
      criticized. New materials and therapeutic options based entirely on adhesion are 
      available nowadays, from direct composite resins to indirect endocrowns. They
      allow for a more conservative, faster, and less expensive dental treatment.
      However, the absence of a metal or high-strength ceramic substructure as in
      full-crown restorations can expose this kind of restoration to a higher risk of
      irreversible fracture in case of crack propagation. The aim of this case report
      is to present a technique to reinforce the cavity of an endodontically treated
      tooth by incorporating a fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) layer into the resin
      coating of the tooth preparation, before the final impressions of the cavity.
      This technique allows the use of FRCs in combination with any kind of restorative
      material for an adhesive overlay/endocrown.

TI  - Influence of cavity preparation design on fracture resistance of posterior
      Leucite-reinforced ceramic restorations.
PG  - 421-9
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Controversy exists concerning the preferred cavity design
      for posterior ceramic restorations to improve their resistance to fracture under 
      occlusal load. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the resistance to
      fracture of leucite-reinforced ceramic restorations placed on molars with
      different cavity preparation designs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety noncarious
      molars were selected, stored in 0.2% thymol solution, and divided into 9 groups
      (n = 10): IT, intact teeth; CsI, conservative inlay; ExI, extensive inlay;
      CsO/mb, conservative onlay with mesio-buccal cusp coverage; ExO/mb, entensive
      onlay with mesio-buccal cusp coverage; CsO/b, conservative onlay with buccal cusp
      coverage; ExO/b, entensive onlay with buccal cusp coverage; CsO/t, conservative
      onlay with total cusp coverage; ExO/t, extensive onlay with total cusp coverage. 
      Teeth were restored with a Leucite-reinforced ceramic (Cergogold). The fracture
      resistance (N) was assessed under compressive load in a universal testing
      machine. The data were analyzed with 1-way and 2-way analyses of variance,
      followed by the Tukey HSD test (alpha = .05). Fracture modes were recorded, based
      on the degree of tooth structure and restoration damage. RESULTS: One-way
      analysis showed that intact teeth had the highest fracture resistance values.
      Two-way analyses showed no significant differences for the isthmus extention
      factor, but showed a significant difference for the preparation design type of
      fracture (P = .03), and also for the interaction between both factors (P = .013).
      The fracture mode observed in all groups tended to involve only restorations.
      CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, it was observed that cuspal
      coverage does not increase fracture resistance of the posterior tooth-restoration
      complex restored with leucite-reinforced ceramics.

      versus press.
PG  - 336-339
LID - 10.4103/JCD.JCD_31_19 [doi]
AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the vertical marginal
      discrepancy of computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and
      pressable lithium disilicate onlays. Materials and Methods: A maxillary first
      premolar typodont tooth was prepared to receive lithium disilicate onlay.
      Mesio-occluso-distal cavity was prepared with palatal cusp reduction and collar
      preparation. In the proximal box, gingival seat was placed 1 mm coronal to the
      cementoenamel junction and mesiodistal width of the seat was kept to 1 mm. Thirty
      stone models were prepared from thirty rubber base impressions and divided into
      two groups, based on the technique of fabrication of onlays: (1) Group CL
      (CAD/CAM lithium disilicate) and (2) Group PL (Pressable lithium disilicate).
      Fifteen onlays per each group were fabricated by following the manufacturer
      instructions. Marginal fit of all the samples were analyzed by using
      stereomicroscope with Image Analysis software. Statistical analysis was done by
      t-test. Results: Statistical significant difference was found between both the
      groups. The lowest marginal discrepancy (41.46 mum) was measured for Group CL
      (CAD/CAM lithium disilicate) specimens, and the highest (55.95 mum) discrepancy
      was observed on the Group PL (Pressable lithium disilicate) specimens.
      Conclusion: Although there was a statistically significant difference between the
      two groups, marginal gap of both the groups were in clinically acceptable levels.

TI  - Three-year clinical follow-up of posterior teeth restored with leucite-reinforced
      ips empress onlays and partial veneer crowns.
PG  - 340-5
LID - 10.1111/j.1532-849X.2011.00837.x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze the survival rate and failure mode 
      of IPS leucite-reinforced ceramic onlays and partial veneer crowns regarding
      thickness under the following clinical conditions: vital versus nonvital teeth,
      tooth location, and type of opposing dentition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Teeth were
      prepared according to established guidelines for ceramic onlays and partial
      veneer crowns. Before cementation, the restorations were measured for occlusal
      thickness at the central fossa, mesial, and distal marginal ridges, and
      functional and nonfunctional cusps. A total of 210 ceramic restorations were
      cemented in 99 patients within a mean observation period of 2.9 +/- 1.89 years.
      The mode of failure was classified and evaluated as (1) adhesive, (2) cohesive,
      (3) combined failure, (4) decementation, (5) tooth sensitivity, and (6) pulpal
      necrosis. Kaplan, log-rank, and Cox regression tests were used for statistical
      analysis. RESULTS: The failure rate was 3.33% (7/210). Increased material
      thickness produced less probability of failures. Vital teeth were less likely to 
      fail than nonvital teeth. Second molars were five times more susceptible to
      failure than first molars. Tooth sensitivity postcementation and the type of
      opposing dentition were not statistically significant in this study. CONCLUSIONS:
      In this study, thickness of the restorations, tooth vitality, and location of
      teeth in the dental arch influenced restoration failures.

TI  - Longevity of ceramic inlays and onlays luted with a solely light-curing composite
      resin.
PG  - 433-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the longevity of heat-pressed glass ceramic inlays and
      onlays luted with solely light-curing composite resin. METHODS: The records of
      patients who had received a ceramic inlay or onlay at the Heidelberg University
      Department of Conservative Dentistry from 1993 to 2002 were evaluated. The mean
      observation time and the survival probability of the ceramic inlays and onlays
      was calculated with the aid of the Kaplan-Meier algorithm. This was done for the 
      total number of all restorations as well as for various subgroups (number of
      surfaces, tooth type, endodontic condition at the time that the ceramic
      restoration was incorporated, experience of operator). The log-rank test was used
      to compare groups and look for significant differences, and p<0.05 was set to be 
      statistically significant. In addition, 95% confidence intervals of the survival 
      probability values were computed. RESULTS: At the time of the last observation,
      783 (96.7%) of these restorations were still in place. The mean observation
      period for all ceramic restorations was 17.3 months (SD 20.2), with an
      observation interval of between 0 and 116 months. The last loss of a ceramic
      restoration was observed 45 months after it had been placed, so that the survival
      probability of all ceramic restorations amounted to p=0.90 (95% confidence
      interval 0.86-0.94) from this time onward. Factors such as endodontic condition
      of tooth, type of tooth, position of tooth, extent of restoration, experience of 
      operator or gender of patient had no significant influence on the survival
      probability of the ceramic restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Heat-pressed glass ceramic 
      inlays and onlays can be used successfully in routine clinical therapy. In
      addition, this type of inlays and onlays can be placed successfully with solely
      light-curing composite resin.

TI  - Survival of ceramic onlays placed with and without metal reinforcement.
PG  - 548-53
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: All-ceramic molar onlays continue to have higher failures
      from bulk fracture than similar cast metal onlays. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      retrospective study was to compare long-term failure rates and causes for
      posterior sintered feldspathic ceramic (Mirage) onlays placed with and without
      metal substructure reinforcement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nineteen onlays were
      placed with and 78 without metal reinforcement in 50 older adolescent and adult
      patients treated by 2 prosthodontists in a private practice. All onlays opposed
      occluding tooth surfaces. Clinical judgment determined the type of onlay placed. 
      Observational factors included patients, clinicians, onlay sites, and failure
      modes. Acrylic resin maxillary splints were generally provided for patients with 
      multiple onlays or parafunctional habits. Thirty-six dies were also available for
      comparison of the occlusal thickness and taper of intact and failed molar onlays.
      The chi-square test or Fisher exact test, Student t test, and life table survival
      statistics were used to evaluate the data (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Over 6 years,
      failures occurred in 21.1% of onlays placed with metal reinforcement and in 26.9%
      without metal reinforcement. Cumulative survival estimates (+/- standard error)
      were 62.4% +/- 14.7% and 60.5% +/- 6.3%, respectively (P=.84). Bulk fracture
      occurred in 16.5% of molars, independent of metal reinforcement (P=1.00).
      Overall, 11.4% of premolar and 33.9% of molar onlays failed. Irreversible
      pulpitis occurred in 6.2% of all teeth. From the dies, there were no clear
      relationships between either the thickness of occlusal ceramic material or the
      internal preparation taper and molar onlay failures, for onlays placed with or
      without metal reinforcement. CONCLUSION: Sintered ceramic onlays placed with and 
      without metal reinforcement showed a similar incidence of bulk fracture in
      molars. Preparations for both types of onlays were similar.

TI  - Stress distribution in molars restored with inlays or onlays with or without
      endodontic treatment: a three-dimensional finite element analysis.
PG  - 6-12
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(09)60206-7 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Previous research into the strength of endodontically
      treated or vital teeth restored with inlays or onlays has not determined which
      restoration method and material provide the most favorable stress distribution
      upon loading. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to calculate the von Mises
      stresses in a mandibular first molar using a 3-dimensional (3-D) finite element
      model. Models compared endodontically treated and vital teeth, a variety of
      restorative materials, and the use of either inlays or onlays to restore teeth.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four 3-D models of mandibular first molars were created:
      (1) the IV group (inlay restored, vital pulp); (2) the OV group (onlay restored, 
      vital pulp); (3) the IE group (inlay restored, endodontically treated); and (4)
      the OE group (onlay restored, endodontically treated). In each group, 3 types of 
      restorative material were tested: (1) composite resin, (2) ceramic, and (3) gold 
      alloy. The materials had elastic moduli of 19 GPa, 65 GPa, and 96.6 GPa,
      respectively. Each model was subjected to a force of 45 N directed to the
      occlusal surface, applied either vertically or laterally (45 degrees obliquely). 
      The stresses occurring in dentin tissue were calculated. The stress distribution 
      patterns and the maximum von Mises stresses were calculated and compared.
      RESULTS: The different restorative materials exhibited similar stress
      distribution patterns under identical loading conditions. In each group, the
      gold-restored tooth exhibited the highest von Mises stress, followed by ceramic
      and composite resin. The maximum von Mises stress in dentin was found in the IE
      group (16.73 MPa), which was 5 times higher than the highest value found in the
      OV group (2.96 MPa). The highest stresses, which occurred at the floor of the
      preparation and the cervical region in dentin, were in the IE group. The stress
      concentration area in the IE group was also larger. CONCLUSIONS: The results
      indicate that endodontic treatment caused higher stress concentration in dentin
      compared with vital teeth, but that proper restoration can minimize internal
      stresses. In the models, the von Mises stress values increased with the
      increasing elastic modulus of the restorative material. Composite resin onlays
      showed the best performance overall in minimizing internal stresses. As internal 
      stresses are indicated as a prime failure mechanism of the restoration, composite
      resin onlays are expected to better restore structural integrity.

PG  - 1360-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0501.2011.02360.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the fatigue resistance and failure mode of
      porcelain and composite resin crowns and onlays bonded to premolar custom
      zirconia implant abutments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty standardized zirconia
      implant abutments were milled (NeoShape) according to two different restoration
      designs (onlay or crown). Using Cerec 3, the corresponding onlays and crowns were
      fabricated either in ceramic (Paradigm C) or composite resin (Paradigm MZ100),
      resulting in four experimental groups (n = 15). The fitting surfaces of the
      abutments were airborne-particle abraded and cleaned. The intaglio surfaces of
      the restorations were HF-etched and silanated (Paradigm C) or airborne-particle
      abraded and silanated (Paradigm MZ100). Following insertion of the abutments into
      a Morse taper implant (Titamax CM), all restorations were bonded with a zirconia 
      primer (Z-Prime Plus), adhesive resin (Optibond FL), and a preheated light curing
      composite resin (Filtek Z100). Cyclic isometric chewing (5 Hz) was simulated,
      starting with a load of 50N (5000x), followed by stages of 200N, 400N, 600N,
      800N, 1000N, 1200N, and 1400N (25,000x each). Samples were loaded until fracture 
      or to a maximum of 180,000 cycles. The four groups were compared using the life
      table survival analysis (Logrank test at P = 0.05). RESULTS: All composite resin 
      onlays and crowns survived (100% survival rate), while ceramic ones fractured at 
      an average load of 1347N and 1280N, respectively, (survival rate of 46.7% and
      20%) with a significant difference in survival probability (P < 0.0001).
      Fractures consisted in partial or total failure of the restoration only (no
      abutment failure, no screw loosening). CONCLUSIONS: Composite resin onlays and
      crowns bonded to custom zirconia implant abutments presented a significant higher
      survival rate when compared to ceramic onlays and crowns.

AB  - The prototyping protocol to evaluate and make the potential adjustments prior to 
      finalization of the monolithic restorations was described by two clinical
      situations. In the first case report, following the digital impressions using an 
      intraoral scanner (3Shape Trios, 3Shape) for an implant-supported four-unit fixed
      dental prosthesis, a digital design (3Shape Dental System, 3Shape) was performed 
      and a prototype using subtractive CAM (milling) (PMMA, Telio CAD, Ivoclar
      Vivadent) was fabricated. The second case highlights the 3D-printed prototyping
      (additive CAM) (Sheraprint Model Plus UV, Shera) following digital impressions
      using an intraoral scanner and digital design in a patient requiring two opposing
      open-end three-unit fixed dental prostheses. By means of prototyping, the
      esthetic, fitting, and functional properties could be tested and the adjustments 
      were completed on the prototypes. It is suggested that prototyping is an
      efficient tool that minimizes the clinical adjustment need for the final
      restoration while improving the communication between the dental practitioner and
      the technician.

TI  - Prospective clinical 5-year study of ceramic-veneered titanium restorations with 
      the Procera system.
PG  - 514-21
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The biocompatibility of titanium has been well documented, 
      but clinical outcomes of ceramic-veneered titanium restorations were not
      conclusive. PURPOSE: The study presents the results of a 5-year clinical study of
      individual crowns and fixed partial dentures (FPDs) veneered with a low-fusing
      ceramic of the Procera system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients at one clinic
      who required crowns or FPDs during a 2-year period were invited to participate. A
      total of 260 patients received 333 ceramic-veneered Procera restorations (242
      single crowns and 91 FPDs). Clinical registrations were performed annually, and
      the restorations were evaluated according to the California Dental Association
      rating system. At the 5-year follow-up, 198 (76%) patients were examined. Most of
      the loss of patients could be explained. RESULTS: Practically all Procera
      restorations were judged as satisfactory both at baseline and follow-up
      examinations. One artificial crown and 1 FPD were remade because of extensive
      fractures of ceramic veneers. Two FPDs had fractures of a soldered joint, but
      only 1 FPD was replaced. Some minor complications occurred, such as small
      porcelain fractures that could be polished (6% of single crowns, 13% of FPDs) and
      or loosened restorations that were recemented. Other recorded complications were 
      not related to the Procera system but to dental caries, loosened posts and cores,
      and root fractures. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes over a 5-year period for
      ceramic-veneered titanium restorations with the Procera system were favorable.

TI  - Micro-CT Evaluation of Ceramic Inlays: Comparison of the Marginal and Internal
      Fit of Five and Three Axis CAM Systems with a Heat Press Technique.
PG  - 49-58
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12271 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the marginal and internal adaptation of CAD/CAM
      lithium-disilicate inlay restorations fabricated by two milling systems (Five and
      Three-axis), and a traditional heat-press technique. METHODS: Fifteen premolar
      teeth with an MOD cavity preparation were fabricated. Lithium-disilicate inlay
      restorations were obtained by three fabrication techniques and fitted to their
      dies (n = 15/gp) as follows: Group-1, three-axis milling system, Group-2,
      five-axis milling system, Group-3, conventional heat-press technique. Gaps were
      evaluated by X-ray microtomography. Marginal gap (MG), occlusal-marginal gap
      (OMG), proximal-marginal gap (PMG), gingival-marginal gap (GMG), absolute
      marginal discrepancy (AMD), axial-internal gap (AIG), and occlusal-internal gap
      (OIG) were evaluated at 120 different points per inlay. Data were analyzed using 
      repeated measures ANOVA. Pairwise comparisons were conducted for post-hoc testes 
      and the Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons (alpha 
      = 0.007). RESULTS: The heat-press group demonstrated significantly smaller
      mean-values amongst all outcomes compared with CAD/CAM groups except for GMG,
      where there was no statistically significant difference between groups in the
      ANOVA (p = 0.042). Within the CAD/CAM groups, the five-axis group showed
      significantly lower OMG mean-value compared with the three-axis group p < 0.001, 
      and lower AIG mean-value compared with the three-axis group p < 0.001. There was 
      no significant difference between the five-axis and the three-axis groups' AMD,
      MG, PMG, and OIG locations. CONCLUSION: Different fabrication techniques affected
      the marginal and internal adaptation of ceramic inlay restorations. The
      heat-press group showed the best marginal and internal adaptation results;
      however, in every group, all samples were within the clinically acceptable MG
      limit (100 mum). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The marginal fit and internal adaptation 
      of inlay ceramic restorations fabricated by a five-axis milling system have not
      been tested or compared with those fabricated by three-axis machines and the
      conventional heat-press method. The preferred method of inlay fabrication,
      whether in the lab or chair side, may be influenced by the results of this study 
      and could affect future clinical decision-making. (J Esthet Restor Dent 29:49-58,

AB  - SELECTION CRITERIA: The authors searched for all English-language articles in
      MEDLINE through 2004. The electronic search yielded 3844 titles, from which 151
      studies were ultimately selected. The authors also conducted a manual search that
      included searching 8 specialty dental journals that published articles on
      implant-related research during 2001 to 2004. The manual search yielded 25
      additional studies. Overall, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were found.
      Inclusion criteria required studies to have patients clinically examined at
      follow-up and to have reported on the characteristics of the fixed partial
      dentures (FPD) structure. The meta-analysis included 13 of 176 studies in which
      patients with 5 or 10 years of follow-up in a prospective or retrospective study 
      design were evaluated clinically at the end of the follow-up period. KEY STUDY
      FACTOR: The primary exposure was tooth-implant-supported fixed partial dentures
      compared with implant-only supported FPDs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome
      measure was the failure rate of implants in tooth-implant-supported FPDs after 5 
      or 10 years of follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included the failure rate of
      the FPD itself or biological or technical complications. MAIN RESULTS: The
      meta-analysis included 555 patients ranging in age from 17 to 83 years who
      received 1002 implants that supported 538 FPDs. Survival of implants in combined 
      tooth-implant-supported FPDs was 90.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]:
      82.4%-94.5%) after 5 years and 82.1% (95% CI: 55.8%93.6%) after 10 years.
      Survival of FPDs was 94.1% after 5 years and 77.8% after 10 years. There was no
      difference in the failure rates of implant abutments (3.4%) or tooth abutments
      (3.2%) for the FPDs after 5 years. Biological complications were reported in only
      2 of 13 studies after 5 years, and the cumulative rate was 11.7%. CONCLUSIONS:
      The authors concluded that survival rates for implants and FPDs in combined
      tooth-implant-supported FPDs were lower than found in a similar meta-analysis of 
      implant-only-supported FPDs. The worse survival data for FPDs after 10 years for 
      combined tooth-implant support (77.8%) compared with implant-only support (86.7%)
      is based on data in only 60 FPDs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this in-vitro study was to evaluate the influence of
      ceramic thickness and type of dental bonding surface on the fracture resistance
      of non-retentive full-coverage adhesively retained occlusal veneers made from
      lithium disilicate ceramic. METHODS: Seventy-two extracted molars were divided
      into three test groups (N=24) depending on the location of the occlusal veneer
      preparation: solely within enamel, within enamel and dentin or within enamel and 
      an occlusal composite resin filling. For each test group, occlusal all-ceramic
      restorations were fabricated from lithium disilicate ceramic blocks (IPS e.max
      CAD) in three subgroups with different thicknesses ranging from 0.3 to 0.7mm in
      the fissures and from 0.6 to 1.0mm at the cusps. The veneers were etched (5% HF),
      silanated and adhesively luted using a self etching primer and a composite luting
      resin (Multilink Primer A/B and Multilink Automix). After water storage at 37
      degrees C for 3 days and thermal cycling for 7500 cycles at 5-55 degrees C,
      specimens were subjected to dynamic loading in a chewing simulator with 600,000
      loading cycles at 10kg combined with thermal cycling. Unfractured specimens were 
      loaded until fracture using a universal testing machine. Statistical analysis was
      performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction
      for multiple testing. RESULTS: Only specimens in the group with the thickest
      dimension (0.7mm in fissure, 1.0mm at cusp) survived cyclic loading without any
      damage. Survival rates in the remaining subgroups ranged from 50 to 100% for
      surviving with some damage and from 12.5 to 75% for surviving without any damage.
      Medians of final fracture resistance ranged from 610 to 3390N. In groups with
      smaller ceramic thickness, luting to dentin or composite provided statistically
      significant (p</=0.05) higher fracture resistance than luting to enamel only. The
      thickness of the occlual ceramic veneers had a statistically significant
      (p</=0.05) influence on fracture resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest to
      use a thickness of 0.7-1mm for non-retentive full-coverage adhesively retained
      occlusal lithium disilicate ceramic restorations.

PG  - 211-9
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(08)60180-8 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Although composite resin materials are used for posterior
      crown restorations, the influence of preparation design, material thickness,
      convergence angle, and method of cementation on fracture resistance remains
      unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to test the hypothesis
      that minimal preparation designs provide an acceptable level of fracture
      resistance for posterior composite resin crowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Nonreinforced Artglass composite resin crowns (n=128) were fabricated on human
      molars in 16 test groups (n=8). Axial tooth preparation included a 1-mm-deep
      shoulder or a 0.5-mm chamfer preparation, whereas occlusal reduction was either
      0.5 mm or 1.3 mm. The total angle of convergence was 4 or 11 degrees and the
      crowns were cemented either with glass ionomer cement (Ketac Cem) or resin cement
      (2bond2). After 10,000 thermal cycles, crowns were vertically loaded until
      failure occurred; load was measured in newtons. Statistical analysis was
      performed by a 4-way ANOVA (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed
      significant effects of occlusal thickness (P<.001), cement (P<.001), preparation 
      design (P=.011), and convergence angle (P=.001) on the fracture resistance of the
      composite crowns. For composite resin crowns with an occlusal thickness of 0.5
      mm, the resistance to fracture was lower than for crowns with a 1.3-mm thickness.
      Fracture resistance was greater when resin cement was used, and greater for the
      chamfer finish line than for the shoulder finish line. Use of a greater total
      convergence angle reduced fracture resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Fracture resistance
      of composite resin crowns was significantly improved by increasing the occlusal
      thickness of the crowns, by using resin cement, and by reducing the total
      convergence angle.

TI  - Fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth: effect of tooth coloured
      post material and surface conditioning.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - This in vitro study evaluated the effects of the different endodontic posts and
      surface conditioning on the fracture resistance and fracture modes of
      endodontically treated teeth. The experimental groups consisted of zirconia
      ceramic post with a glasss-ceramic core [A], zirconia ceramic post with a
      composite core [B], glass fiber composite post (FRC) with a composite core [C],
      and titanium post with a composite core [D]. All posts in these groups were
      cemented with self-adhesive resin cement (Rely X Unicem Aplicap) combination with
      tribochemical silica coating (TSC). Groups E, F, G and H comprised the same
      post-and-core materials as the first 4 groups but cemented with the same resin
      cement without TSC. Specimens were subjected to thermal cycling between 5 degrees
      C and 55 degrees C for a total of 5000 cycles with 30s per cycle. Static load was
      applied to the palatal surface of each specimen until they were fractured.
      Statistical analysis was conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
      post-hoc comparisons (Tukey). The fracture resistance was significantly affected 
      by the post material (P < 0.001) and surface conditioning (P < 0.001; two-way
      ANOVA). The application of TSC to post surface decreased the fracture resistance 
      of zirconia ceramic post with composite core (p=0.002; Tukey) and glass FRC post 
      with composite core (p=0.029; Tukey). No catastrophic failure was observed for
      groups B, C, D, E, F and G. Under the testing conditions used, the titanium
      post/composite core that had been silicoated exhibited the highest fracture
      resistance.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The fracture of implant-supported restorations, especially 
      of the veneering layer, is a common problem in dentistry. Monolithic ceramic or
      resin restorations might help solve this problem. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in
      vitro study was to obtain additional insight into the risk of fracture of
      implant-supported restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Identical crowns (n=10) of 
      10 different ceramic and composite resin materials were cemented on conventional 
      abutments on implant replicas embedded in polymethyl methacrylate blocks. The
      specimens were subjected to compressive load in a universal testing machine to
      record initial load to failure (ILF). Additionally, the flexural strength (FS),
      compressive strength (CS), and elastic modulus (E) of the investigated materials 
      were determined. These results were used in a finite element analysis model of a 
      composite resin and a lithium disilicate crown. RESULTS: Anatomic contour
      zirconia (Lava Plus) crowns had the highest ILF (6065 N), followed by lithium
      disilicate (IPS e.max) (2788 N) and the composite resin materials (Protemp 4,
      Majesty Flow, Telio CAD, Estenia C&B, Lava Ultimate, VITA Enamic) (2386 to 1935
      N). Veneered zirconia (Lava) crowns showed the lowest ILF (1477 N). The highest
      FS, CS, and E were found for Lava Plus and IPS e.max. No direct relationship was 
      found between ILF and the FS, CS, or E. The finite element analysis showed
      stresses that did not exceed the FS or CS of IPS e.max. The surface roughness of 
      these crowns might have caused initial failure at relatively low stresses.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this laboratory study, monolithic implant-supported crowns showed
      a higher ILF than conventional veneered ceramic crowns. Monolithic ceramic
      restorations might perform better than composite resin crowns.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Only a few studies exist, which assess the clinical long-term
      behavior of all-ceramic FDPs in the posterior region. The aim of the present
      prospective clinical study was to evaluate the clinical performance of posterior 
      three-unit FDPs manufactured from Y-TZP after a service period up to 10 years.
      METHODS: 55 patients received 59 three-unit FDPs in the posterior region of the
      maxilla or mandible. Abutment teeth were prepared and full-arch impressions were 
      taken. Definitive casts were fabricated and optically scanned. Frameworks were
      fabricated with computer-aided design (CAD) and manufacturing (CAM) technology.
      Y-TZP frameworks were veneered and adhesively luted to the abutment teeth.
      Baseline and follow-up examinations (service time: >/= 48 months) were recorded
      by applying modified United States Public Health Services (USPHS) rating
      criteria. Cumulative survival rate was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier. Percentage of 
      biological and technical complication was calculated. RESULTS: Fifty-three
      patients with 57 FDPs attended the last follow-up visit and a mean observation
      period of the remaining was 6.3 +/- 1.9 years was calculated. Biological
      complications occurred in 17.5%, technical complications in 28% of the FDPs. The 
      10-year cumulative survival rate amounted 85.0%. Three FDPs failed to survive,
      two due to a root fracture of the abutment tooth and one due to secondary caries.
      CONCLUSIONS: Three-unit FDPs made from Y-TZP, veneered with ceramic offer a
      treatment option with a high rate of chipping. However, the manufacturing
      processes nowadays are modified in order to avoid this complication. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the present investigation suggest that three-unit
      Y-TZP posterior FDPs may are a possible treatment option. However, a high rate of
      chipping can be expected.

      An In Vitro Biomechanical Study.
PG  - 340-346
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12499 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of different silica-based ceramic materials on
      the mechanical failure behavior of endocrowns used in the restoration of
      endodontically treated mandibular molar teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six 
      intact mandibular molar teeth extracted because of a loss of periodontal support 
      received root canal treatment. The teeth were prepared with a central cavity to
      support the endocrowns, replacing the occlusal surface with mesial-lingual-distal
      walls. Data acquisition of the prepared tooth surfaces was carried out digitally 
      with a powder-free intraoral scanner. Restoration designs were completed on
      manufactured restorations from three silicate ceramics: alumina-silicate
      (control), zirconia-reinforced (Zr-R), and polymer-infiltrated (P-I). Following
      adhesive cementation, endocrowns were subjected to thermal aging, and then, each 
      specimen was obliquely loaded to record the fracture strength and define the
      mechanical failure. For the failure definition, the fracture type characteristics
      were identified, and further analytic measurements were made on the fractured
      tooth and ceramic structure. RESULTS: Load-to-fracture failure did not differ
      significantly, and the calculated mean values were 1035.08 N, 1058.33 N, and
      1025.00 N for control, Zr-R, and P-I groups, respectively; however, the stiffness
      of the restoration-tooth complex was significantly higher than that in both test 
      groups. No statistically significant correlation was established in paired
      comparisons of the failure strength, restorative stiffness, and fractured tooth
      distance parameters. The failure mode for teeth restored with zirconia-reinforced
      glass ceramics was identified as non-restorable. The resin interface in the
      control and P-I groups presented similar adhesive failure behavior. CONCLUSION:
      Mechanical failure of endocrown restorations does not significantly differ for
      silica-based ceramics modified either with zirconia or polymer.

TI  - Survival Rates of Splinted and Nonsplinted Prostheses Supported by Short Dental
      Implants (</=8.5 mm): A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 9-21
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13402 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the implant survival rates, marginal bone loss, 
      and mechanical complications of prostheses supported by splinted and nonsplinted 
      short implants (</=8.5 mm). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic database (MEDLINE,
      CENTRAL, Web of Science, and EMBASE) and manual searches up to May 2021 were
      conducted to identify studies comparing splinted and nonsplinted short implants
      (</=8.5 mm). The primary outcome was implant survival rate. Secondary outcomes
      were marginal bone loss and mechanical complications. The quality of included
      studies and risk-of-bias were assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A
      random-effects model was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Twelve studies
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria and featured 1506 short implants (596
      nonsplinted and 910 splinted) with a follow-up time ranging from 1 to 16 years.
      Quantitative analysis found no statistically significant differences between
      splinted and nonsplinted short implants (</=8.5 mm) for survival rate (RR = 0.98;
      95% CI 0.96, 1.01; p = 0.26)) and marginal bone loss (SMD = -0.08; 95% CI - 0.23,
      0.07; p = 0.28). Veneer chipping, abutment screw breakage, screw loosening, and
      loss of retention were reported in the selected studies as common complications. 
      However, no statistically significant difference was found between splinted and
      nonsplinted short implants (RR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.20, 1.54; p = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS:
      Within the limitations of the present meta-analysis, it might be concluded that
      splinted short implants (</=8.5 mm) do not present superior performance in
      survival rate, marginal bone maintenance and prevention of mechanical
      complications compared with single-unit prostheses.

TI  - Ferrule-Effect Dominates Over Use of a Fiber Post When Restoring Endodontically
      Treated Incisors: An In Vitro Study.
PG  - 396-406
LID - 10.2341/16-243-L [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the restoration of
      broken-down endodontically treated incisors with the ferrule effect using glass
      ceramic crowns bonded to composite resin core buildups with or without a fiber
      post. A no-ferrule group with post was also included for comparison. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: Thirty decoronated endodontically treated bovine incisors with a 2-mm 
      ferrule were restored with a direct buildup using a nanohybrid direct composite
      resin (Miris 2 and Optibond FL) with or without a glass-fiber-reinforced post. An
      additional group of 15 teeth without a ferrule were restored with buildup and a
      fiber post. All teeth were prepared to receive bonded glass ceramic crowns (e.max
      CAD luted with Variolink Esthetic DC) and were subjected to accelerated fatigue
      testing. Cyclic isometric loading was applied to the incisal edge at an angle of 
      30 degrees and a frequency of 5 Hz, beginning with a load of 100 N (x5000
      cycles). A 100 N load increase was applied each 15,000 cycles. Specimens were
      loaded until failure or to a maximum of 1000 N (x140,000 cycles). Groups were
      compared using the Kaplan Meier survival analysis (log rank test at p=0.05).
      RESULTS: None of the tested specimens withstood all 140,000 load cycles.
      Specimens with posts but without a ferrule were affected by an initial failure
      phenomenon (wide gap at the lingual margin between the buildup/crown assembly and
      the root). There was a significant difference in mean survived cycles between the
      ferrule groups (Fp=73,332x and FNp=73,244x) and the no-ferrule group (50,121x;
      p=0.001). The addition of a fiber post was not significant in the presence of the
      ferrule (p=0.884). In both groups with posts, 100% of failures were unrestorable.
      The no-post group had 47% of restorable and possibly restorable failures.
      CONCLUSIONS: The survival of broken-down nonvital incisors was improved by the
      presence of the ferrule but not by the fiber-reinforced post. Fiber posts were
      always detrimental to the failure mode and were not able to compensate for the
      absence of a ferrule.

TI  - Direct restoration of severely damaged incisors using short fiber-reinforced
      composite resin.
PG  - 731-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the static
      load-bearing capacity and the failure mode of endodontically treated maxillary
      incisors restored with complete crowns made of experimental composite resin (FC) 
      with short fiber fillers, with and without root canal posts. Further aim was to
      evaluate the effect of fiber-reinforced composite resin (FRC) on the failure mode
      of the restoration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experimental composite resin (FC)
      was prepared by mixing 22.5 wt.% of short E-glass fibers (3mm in length) and 22.5
      wt.% of semi-interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) resin with 55 wt.% of silane 
      treated silica fillers. The clinical crowns of 30 human extracted maxillary
      incisors were sectioned at the cemento-enamel junction. Five groups of direct
      complete crowns were fabricated (n=6); Group A: made from particulate filler
      composite resin (PFC) (Grandio Caps, VOCO, control), Group B: PFC with fiber post
      (everStick, StickTeck), Group C: made from PFC with everStick fiber post and
      FRC-substructure, Group D: made from FC, Group E: made from FC with
      FRC-substructure. The root canals were prepared and posts were cemented with
      resin cement (ParaCem Universal). All restored teeth were stored in water at room
      temperature for 24h before they were statically loaded with speed of 1.0 mm/min
      until fracture. Data were analyzed using ANOVA (p=0.05). Failure modes were
      visually examined. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed that restorations made from
      experimental fiber composite resin had higher load-bearing capacity (349N)
      (p<0.05) than the control restorations (173N). No significant difference was
      found in load-bearing capacity between restorations reinforced with
      FRC-substructure and those without (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Restorations made from 
      short glass fiber containing composite resin with IPN-polymer matrix showed
      better load-bearing capacity than those made with either plain PFC or PFC
      reinforced with fiber post.

TI  - Evaluation of two different CAD-CAM inlay-onlays in a split-mouth study: 2-year
      clinical follow-up.
PG  - 244-250
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12541 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical performance of hybrid ceramic inlay-onlay
      restorations over a 2-year period. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS: A total of 30 lithium
      disilicate glass ceramic (LDC; control group) and 30 hybrid ceramic (HC; test
      group) inlay/onlay restorations were performed in 14 patients. Clinical
      evaluations were performed after 1 week, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years of
      cementation according to the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS)
      criteria, gingival index, and plaque index. The Friedman test was used for the
      significant difference in time and Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the
      determination of differences. The clinical parameters, gingival and plaque
      indexes differences in time were analyzed with Chi-square test. No statistically 
      significant difference (P > .05) was found between the two groups in the modified
      USPHS, gingival index, and plaque index evaluations, whether statistically
      significant differences were found within groups. The total survival rate was
      100% for both groups after 2 years. CONCLUSION: Based on the 2-year data, the
      tested HC can be considered a reliable material for inlay/onlay restorations.
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this in vivo study suggest that both resin 
      nanoceramic materials and LDC materials have been successfully incorporated in
      treatments of inlay and onlay restorations. Short-term results showed that resin 
      nanoceramic materials can be counted as a good choice in inlay and onlay
      restorations in an effort to reduce the treatment time associated with ceramic
      firing processes.

TI  - A 3-year prospective study of implant-supported, single-tooth restorations of
      all-ceramic and metal-ceramic materials in patients with tooth agenesis.
PG  - 1078-87
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0501.2012.02514.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this clinical study was to describe outcome variables 
      of all-ceramic and metal-ceramic implant-supported, single-tooth restorations.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 59 patients (mean age: 27.9 years) with tooth
      agenesis and treated with 98 implant-supported single-tooth restorations were
      included in this study. Two patients did not attend baseline examination, but all
      patients were followed for 3 years. The implants supported 52 zirconia, 21
      titanium and 25 gold alloy abutments, which retained 64 all-ceramic and 34
      metal-ceramic crowns. At baseline and 3-year follow-up examinations, the
      biological outcome variables such as survival rate of implants, marginal bone
      level, modified Plaque Index (mPlI), modified Sulcus Bleeding Index (mBI) and
      biological complications were registered. The technical outcome variables
      included abutment and crown survival rate, marginal adaptation of crowns, cement 
      excess and technical complications. The aesthetic outcome was assessed by using
      the Copenhagen Index Score, and the patient-reported outcomes were recorded using
      the OHIP-49 questionnaire. The statistical analyses were mainly performed by
      using mixed model of ANOVA for quantitative data and PROC NLMIXED for ordinal
      categorical data. RESULTS: The 3-year survival rate was 100% for implants and 97%
      for abutments and crowns. Significantly more marginal bone loss was registered at
      gold-alloy compared to zirconia abutments (P = 0.040). The mPlI and mBI were not 
      significantly different at three abutment materials. The frequency of biological 
      complications was higher at restorations with all-ceramic restorations than
      metal-ceramic crowns. Loss of retention, which was only observed at metal-ceramic
      crowns, was the most frequent technical complication, and the marginal
      adaptations of all-ceramic crowns were significantly less optimal than
      metal-ceramic crowns (P = 0.020). The professional-reported aesthetic outcome
      demonstrated significantly superior colour match of all-ceramic over
      metal-ceramic crowns (P = 0.015). However, no significant differences in the
      other aesthetic parameters at various restoration materials were registered.
      After 3 years, the patient-reported outcome variables at different restoration
      materials were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: The biological outcomes
      at the zirconia and metal abutments were comparable. All-ceramic crowns
      demonstrated better colour match, but higher frequency of marginal discrepancy
      compared to metal-ceramic crowns. Generally, the patients noticed no difference
      in aesthetic outcome of all-ceramic and metal-ceramic restorations.

TI  - Prognosis of Indirect Composite Resin Cuspal Coverage on Endodontically Treated
      Premolars and Molars: An In Vivo Prospective Study.
PG  - 598-604
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12545 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This prospective clinical study evaluated the success rate of indirect
      composite resin cuspal coverage on endodontically treated molars and premolars
      and the survival rate of the restored teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred
      fifty endodontically treated teeth were restored with total resin cuspal coverage
      and randomly selected for the study. Patients were recalled after 2 to 5 years
      for clinical evaluation. Data were subjected to standard tests of statistical
      correlations using Spearman test. RESULTS: Out of the 150 teeth, 84 were molars
      and 66 were premolars. Of these teeth, 58.7% had mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD)
      cavities, 20.7% had mesio-occlusal (MO), and 20.7% had occlusal-distal (OD). A
      build-up procedure was performed in 51.3% of the teeth, and buccal veneer
      composite resins were placed at the margins of 96.7% of the teeth. Out of the 150
      teeth, 30 (20%) presented margin discoloration, 3 teeth (2%) had restoration
      reparable fractures, 2 teeth (1.3%) had restoration irreparable fractures, and 1 
      tooth (0.7%) exhibited secondary recurrent caries. The opposing arch that
      occluded with the treated teeth presented 58% natural teeth (no restoration
      material), 26.7% ceramic crowns, and 15.3% implant-supported ceramic crowns.
      Statistically significant differences (p = 0.018) between irreparable restoration
      fractures and the type of support material present in the opposing arch were
      found. CONCLUSIONS: In a period of up to 5 years, the resin cuspal coverage of
      endodontic treated teeth had a success rate of 96%, while the tooth survival rate
      was 100%. The type of support material on the opposing arch may influence the
      longevity of the restoration of endodontically treated teeth.

TI  - Ex vivo fracture resistance of direct resin composite complete crowns with and
      without posts on maxillary premolars.
PG  - 230-7
AB  - AIM: To investigate ex vivo the fracture resistance and failure mode of direct
      resin composite complete crowns with and without various root canal posts made on
      maxillary premolars. METHODOLOGY: The clinical crowns of 40 human extracted
      single-rooted maxillary premolars were sectioned at the cemento-enamel junction. 
      The canals were prepared with Gates Glidden drills up to size 4. Thirty samples
      were provided with standardized post spaces in the palatal canal and all roots
      were embedded in acrylic. Minimal standardized preparations in the canal
      entrances were made. Groups of 10 samples were treated with (i) prefabricated
      metal posts, (ii) prefabricated glass fibre posts, (iii) custom-made glass fibre 
      posts, and (iv) no posts (control). Posts were cemented with resin cement and
      resin composite complete crowns were made. All specimens were thermocycled
      (6000x, 5-55 degrees C). Static load until fracture was applied using a universal
      loading device (crosshead speed 5 mm min(-1)) at a loading angle of 30 degrees . 
      Failure modes were categorized as favourable and unfavourable failures. RESULTS: 
      No significant difference was observed between the mean failure loads (group 1:
      1386 N, group 2: 1276 N, group 3: 1281 N, and group 4: 1717 N, P > 0.05), nor
      between frequencies of failure modes (P > 0.05). All failures were fractures of
      the resin composite crown in combination with tooth material (cohesive failures).
      CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of this laboratory investigation it is concluded
      that severely damaged and root filled maxillary premolars, restored with direct
      resin composite complete crowns without posts have similar fracture resistances
      and failure modes compared to those with various posts, which suggest that posts 
      are not necessarily required.

TI  - Effect of Thermomechanical and Static Loading on the Load to Fracture of
      Metal-Ceramic, Monolithic, and Veneered Zirconia Posterior Fixed Partial
      Dentures.
PG  - 171-178
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13008 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of static (not preloaded) and thermomechanical
      loading on the load to fracture of metal-ceramic, monolithic and veneered
      zirconia computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) posterior
      fixed partial dentures (FPDs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred standardized
      specimens with 2 abutments screwed onto a platform were prepared from stainless
      steel to receive a posterior 3-unit FPD with an intermediate pontic. Specimens
      were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 20): Metal-ceramic (control group), Lava
      Zirconia system, Vita In-Ceram YZ, IPS e.max ZirCAD, and Lava Plus. Half of the
      specimens of each group (n = 10) underwent no preloading, and the other half were
      subjected to thermomechanical loading in a masticatory simulator, and then all
      FPDs were loaded until fracture using a universal testing machine at a 1 mm/min
      crosshead speed. The load to fracture of the veneering ceramic and the load to
      fracture of framework (total fracture) were recorded for each specimen. Data were
      statistically analyzed using 2-way ANOVA, Tukey's HSD post-hoc test, Student's t 
      test, and Weibull statistics, alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: Significant differences were
      recorded between the metal-ceramic and veneered zirconia groups for the veneering
      ceramic load (p < 0.001; f = 36.62; f = 57.76) in no preloading and
      thermomechanical loading subgroups, respectively, but no differences were
      observed between the static and thermomechanical loading conditions. No
      differences were observed among the veneered zirconia groups. For the total load 
      to fracture, significant differences were observed according to the material (p <
      0.001; f = 500.8), between the metal-ceramic and Lava Plus group and the other
      zirconia groups in no preloading subgroup, and between metal-ceramic and the
      other groups (p < 0.001; f = 303.33) in thermomechanical loading subgroup. For
      the type of preloading, significant differences were observed (p = 0.02; f =
      5.24) between the Lava Plus group and the other groups. Thermomechanical loading 
      significantly decreased the fracture load of the Lava Plus group (p = 0.005). The
      Weibull statistics corroborated the results. CONCLUSIONS: Monolithic zirconia
      restorations provided the highest load to fracture values among the zirconia
      groups tested; however, the results indicate that they must be used in the oral
      environment with caution, because their load to fracture was influenced by the
      aging simulation.

TI  - A clinical evaluation of cobalt-chromium metal-ceramic fixed partial dentures and
      crowns: A three- to seven-year retrospective study.
PG  - 6-16
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: In severely compromised dentition, loading of long-span and
      cantilever metal-ceramic fixed partial dentures (FPDs) could result in framework 
      deformation and porcelain fractures. The use of cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloys
      may be advantageous, but there is little information on the longevity of, and
      complications with, prostheses made with these alloys. PURPOSE: The aim of this
      retrospective study was to report the survival and complication rates of Co-Cr
      metal-ceramic FPDs and crowns followed over a 3- to 7-year period. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: The study included 42 patients with a total of 51 FPDs and 12 single
      crowns assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The 3 groups comprised patients with abutment
      teeth with a questionable prognosis (n=10), advanced chronic periodontitis
      (n=19), or abutment teeth with a positive prognosis (n=13). The FPDs had a mean
      of 9.7 units (range of 3-14). Of the FPDs, 32 were provided with a cantilever on 
      1 side (n=24) or both sides (n=8). The mean observation time was 51 months (range
      of 28-82). All patients were examined by 2 independent prosthodontists using the 
      California Dental Association (CDA) assessment system for evaluation. One-way
      ANOVA with Fisher's LSD post hoc test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for
      statistical analyses (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Seventeen (34%) of the FPDs had
      biological and/or technical complications. Six (12%) FPDs were completely or
      partially removed during the observation period, 1 framework fractured, and 9
      (17.6%) FPDs had ceramic fractures. Fifteen of the 21 fractured FPD units were
      related to FPDs that were placed in 3 patients with bruxing habits. The CDA
      rating for marginal integrity was ""excellent"" for more than 98% of the abutments.
      No patients reported adverse reactions to the material. CONCLUSIONS:
      Metal-ceramic FPDs made of cobalt-chromium alloy performed acceptably in the
      questionable prognosis and advanced chronic periodontitis groups.

TI  - The effect of alveolar bone loss on the load capability of restored
      endodontically treated teeth: a comparative in vitro study.
PG  - 790-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present investigation was to study the influence of a 
      reduced bone support on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth
      restored with glass fibre-reinforced posts (FRC). METHODS: 30 caries-free
      maxillary central incisors were divided into 3 groups (n=10). Endodontic
      treatment was performed. Teeth were flattened 2 mm above the cemento-enamel
      junction. Group I (control) simulated a clinical situation without horizontal
      bone loss. In group II a horizontal bone loss of 25% and in group III of 50% was 
      simulated. All specimens received FRC posts and composite core restorations.
      All-ceramic crowns were adhesively cemented. Specimens were exposed to thermal
      cycling and mechanical loading (TCML) and finally statically loaded until failure
      in a universal testing machine (v=1 mm/min). Non-parametric tests were used to
      compare median fracture loads between groups. Fracture modes were compared using 
      Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The median fracture load values (min/max) in [N]
      were: group I=501 (326/561), group II=422 (323/495); group III=352 (266/406),
      p=0.004. Two specimens in each group II and III failed during TCML. Statistical
      analysis revealed statistically significant differences between all test groups
      regarding maximum fracture load and mode of fracture. CONCLUSIONS: The fracture
      resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored adhesively with a FRC post,
      composite core, and all-ceramic crown is dependent on the level of surrounding
      supporting periodontal bone. Loss of alveolar bone loss due to periodontal
      disease may lead to an increased risk of failure.

TI  - In vitro evaluation of push-out bond strength of direct ceramic inlays to tooth
      surface with fiber-reinforced composite at the interface.
PG  - 271-8
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Failure of a restoration, where a part of a ceramic inlay
      and/or a cusp is fractured, is a common clinical problem. The application of
      fiber-reinforced composites at the tooth-inlay interface may prevent undesirable 
      fractures in dental restorations. There is little information regarding the
      effect of a fiber- reinforced composite layer on the push-out bond strength of
      ceramic inlays to tooth structure. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to
      compare push-out bond strengths of ceramic inlays to tooth structure using a
      layer of fiber weave-reinforced composite at the tooth interface with different
      adhesive systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty standardized occlusal,
      conically-shaped cavities, 5 mm in occlusal diameter, 3.5 mm in cervical diameter
      and 3.5 mm deep, were prepared in extracted human molars using a truncated
      cone-shaped diamond rotary cutting instrument, the dimensions of which
      corresponded with those of prefabricated ceramic inlays. The teeth were divided
      into 2 groups according to the adhesive system used. Solobond Plus was used as a 
      total-etching system and Futurabond NR as a self-etching system. Preetched and
      silanized ceramic inlays were bonded to tooth structure with or without a layer
      of bidirectional fiber weave (StickTech). The groups without fiber-reinforced
      composite layer served as controls. The inlays were cemented with
      dual-polymerizing luting composite (Bifix QM) and light polymerized for 40
      seconds from the buccal, lingual, and occlusal surfaces. Specimens were thermal
      cycled (6000 x 5 degrees -55 degrees C) and 3.5-mm-thick discs were prepared for 
      the push-out test. The discs (n=10) were tested in a universal testing machine
      and pushed out with a cross-head speed of 1.0 mm/min. The data were analyzed with
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) (alpha=.05). Failure modes were analyzed using a
      stereomicroscope and SEM. RESULTS: Push-out mean bond strength (SD) values in MPa
      of direct ceramic inlays were: Solobond Plus (control): 9.7 (3.9), Solobond Plus 
      with fiber-reinforced composite: 10.5 (5.0), Futurabond NR (control): 8.4 (2.5), 
      Futurabond NR with fiber-reinforced composite: 8.6 (2.2). The differences between
      groups were not significant for either adhesive system or with the use of
      fiber-reinforced composite layer at the interface. Mixed failures were observed
      in the control groups, whereas in the fiber-reinforced composite layer groups,
      failures were mostly cohesive within the fiber layer. No cohesive fracture of the
      tooth was observed when a layer of fiber weave was placed at the interface.
      CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this in vitro study, a fiber-reinforced
      composite layer at the bonding interface of ceramic inlay did not influence the
      push-out bond strength. Futurabond NR self-etching system and Solobond Plus
      total-etching system demonstrated similar push-out bond strengths.

PG  - 395-402
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this clinical retrospective study was to evaluate the
      clinical performance and longevity of glass-ceramic onlays and inlays in
      stress-bearing posterior teeth. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Five hundred forty-seven
      posterior teeth in the maxillae and mandibles of 120 patients (46 males, 74
      females) were restored with 213 onlays, 38 single-surface inlays, 141 two-surface
      inlays, and 155 three-surface inlays between 1987 and 2009 at Innsbruck Medical
      University, Innsbruck, Austria, by two experienced dentists. The restoration
      sample included 9 (1.6%) nonvital teeth and 40 (33%) patients diagnosed with
      bruxism. The study population was examined clinically during regularly scheduled 
      maintenance appointments. The risk of failure was determined using Kaplan-Meier
      survival analyses. RESULTS: The mean observation periods for onlays and all
      inlays were 80 +/- 34 months and 111 +/- 63 months, respectively. Twenty-seven
      failures were recorded. The estimated survival rates for onlays and all inlays
      after 5, 10, and 12 years were 98.9% and 98.9%, 92.4% and 96.8%, and 92.4% and
      89.6%, respectively. Nonvital teeth showed a significantly higher risk of failure
      (P < .001). There was no greater risk of failure associated with existing
      parafunction (bruxism) (P = .408). Restorations on premolars survived longer in
      the first 15 years than restorations on molars, but no statistical significance
      was found (P = .913). CONCLUSION: Glass-ceramic onlays and inlays were
      demonstrated to be successful in posterior teeth; however, at this time, their
      efficacy is inferior to that of cast gold restorations.

TI  - Short-term results of IPS-Empress inlays and onlays.
PG  - 277-87
AB  - PURPOSE: A leucite-reinforced, glass-ceramic material was recently introduced for
      clinical use. In this clinical trial, IPS-Empress inlays and onlays were
      evaluated using the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS)
      criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The teeth of 36 patients were restored with 105 
      posterior inlays and 25 onlays, fabricated by an indirect technique. After
      etching the restorations with hydrofluoric acid, they were silanized and luted
      using composite cements. The restorations were evaluated visually, clinically
      with a mirror and probe, and by bitewing radiographs and clinical photographs,
      using modified USPHS criteria. Restorations having neither charlie nor delta
      criteria were defined as successful, and their survival rate was calculated
      according to Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The mean observation period for the 
      130 restorations was 23.4 +/- 6.1 months. After 2 years, 127 restorations were
      successful with an estimated survival rate of 97.5%. Three restorations failed
      because of fractures. The esthetic results were excellent. CONCLUSIONS: The
      initial clinical results of this esthetic restorative material are encouraging.
      However, because of fatigue phenomena for all ceramic materials, a longer
      observation period is needed to provide a definitive prognosis of the long-term
      clinical behavior.

TI  - A Novel Full-Digital Protocol (SCAN-PLAN-MAKE-DONE((R))) for the Design and
      Fabrication of Implant-Supported Monolithic Translucent Zirconia Crowns Cemented 
      on Customized Hybrid Abutments: A Retrospective Clinical Study on 25 Patients.
LID - E317 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16030317 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To present a novel, full-digital protocol for the design and fabrication
      of implant-supported monolithic translucent zirconia crowns cemented on
      customized hybrid abutments. METHODS: The present retrospective clinical study
      was based on data from patients who had been treated with single Morse-taper
      connection implants (Exacone((R)), Leone Implants, Florence, Italy) and were
      prosthetically restored with monolithic translucent zirconia crowns, cemented on 
      customized hybrid abutments. The full-digital protocol (SCAN-PLAN-MAKE-DONE((R)))
      consisted of 8 phases: (1) intraoral scan of the implant position with scanbody; 
      (2) computer-assisted design (CAD) of the individual abutment (saved as
      ""supplementary abutment design"" in external folder) and temporary crown; (3)
      milling of the individual zirconia abutment and of the temporary
      polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) crown, with extraoral cementation of the zirconia 
      abutment on the relative titanium bonding base, to generate an individual hybrid 
      abutment; (4) clinical application of the individual hybrid abutment and
      cementation of the temporary PMMA crown; (5) two months later, intraoral scan of 
      the individual hybrid abutment in position; (6) CAD of the final crown with
      margin line design on the previously saved ""supplementary abutment design"",
      superimposed on the second scan of the abutment in position; (7) milling of the
      final crown in monolithic translucent zirconia, sintering, and characterization; 
      and (8) clinical application of the final crown. All patients were followed for a
      period of 1 year. The primary outcomes of this study were the marginal adaptation
      of the final crown (checked clinically and radiographically), the quality of
      occlusal and interproximal contact points at delivery, and the aesthetic
      integration; the secondary outcomes were the 1-year survival and success of the
      implant-supported restoration. An implant-supported restoration was considered
      successful in the absence of any biological or prosthetic complication, during
      the entire follow-up period. RESULTS: In total, 25 patients (12 males, 13
      females; 26(-)74 years of age; mean age 51.1 +/- 13.3 years) who had been
      restored with 40 implant-supported monolithic translucent zirconia crowns were
      included in this study. At delivery, the marginal adaptation was perfect for all 
      crowns. However, there were occlusal issues (2/40 crowns: 5%), interproximal
      issues (1/40 crowns: 2.5%), and aesthetic issues (1/40 crowns: 2.5%). The overall
      incidence of issues at delivery was therefore 10% (4/40 crowns). At 1 year, one
      implant failed; thus the survival of the restorations was 97.5% (39/40 crowns in 
      function). Among the surviving implant-supported restorations, three experienced 
      complications (one loss of connection between the hybrid abutment and the
      implant, one decementation of the zirconia abutment, and one decementation of the
      zirconia crown). The success of restorations amounted to 92.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      restoration of single Morse-taper connection implants with monolithic translucent
      zirconia crowns cemented on customized hybrid abutments via the novel
      SCAN-PLAN-MAKE-DONE((R)) full-digital protocol seems to represent a reliable
      treatment option. However, further studies on a larger number of patients and
      dealing with different prosthetic restorations (such as implant-supported fixed
      partial prostheses) are needed to confirm the validity of this protocol.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of chairside Computer Assisted Design/Computer Assisted
      Machining nano-ceramic restorations: Five-year status.
PG  - 193-203
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12516 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This investigation was a longitudinal, randomized clinical trial to
      measure the clinical performance of a nano-ceramic material (Lava Ultimate/3M)
      for chairside Computer Assisted Design/Computer Assisted Machining (CAD/CAM)
      fabricated restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty chairside 
      CAD/CAM onlays were restored with a CEREC system randomly assigned to 60
      leucite-reinforced ceramic (IPS EmpressCAD/Ivoclar Vivadent AGBendererstrasse
      2FL-9494 SchaanLiechtenstein) onlays and 60 nano-ceramic (Lava Ultimate/3M)
      onlays. Equal groups of onlays were cemented using a self-etch and a total etch
      adhesive resin cement. The onlays were recalled for a period of 5 years. RESULTS:
      At 1 week postoperatively, 10% of the onlays cemented with both the self-etch and
      total etch adhesive resin cements were reported as slightly sensitive. However,
      all patients were asymptomatic by the 4th week without treatment. Four
      leucite-reinforced onlays and one nano-ceramic onlay fractured and required
      replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Adhesive retention with a self-etch or total etch
      cementation technique resulted in a similar clinical outcome with no reported
      debonds. The nano-ceramic onlays had a lower incidence of fracture compared to
      the leucite-reinforced ceramic onlays with both having a very low risk of
      fracture. Nano-ceramic onlays performed equally as well as glass ceramic onlays
      over 5 years of clinical service. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Ceramic materials have
      been a mainstay for chairside CAD/CAM restorations for the past 30 years and a
      new category of resilient ceramics with a resin matrix has been introduced
      reported to offer ceramic-like durability and esthetics with resin-like
      efficiency in handling. There are no long-term clinical studies on the
      performance of these materials. This is a 5-year randomized clinical trial on the
      performance of nano-ceramic onlays.

      Crowns Fabricated with Complete Digital Workflow: Two-Year Follow-Up.
LID - 672 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15020672 [doi]
AB  - Clinical studies on the behavior of posterior translucent monolithic zirconia
      restorations are lacking. We assessed the clinical outcome and survival rate of
      posterior third-generation monolithic zirconia crowns over a 2-year period. A
      total of 24 patients, requiring 30 posterior full-contour restorations were
      selected. All abutments were scanned, and crowns were milled and cemented with a 
      self-adhesive dual cure cement. Crowns were assessed using the California Dental 
      Association's criteria. Gingival status was assessed by evaluating the gingival
      index, plaque index, periodontal probing depth of the abutments and control
      teeth, and the margin index of the abutment teeth. Statistical analyses were
      performed using the Friedman and the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. During the
      2-year follow-up, no biological or mechanical complications were observed, and
      the survival and success rate was 100%. All restorations ranked as satisfactory
      throughout the follow-up period. The gingival index and plaque index were worse
      at the end of the 2-year follow-up. The margin index was stable during the 2
      years of clinical service. No significant differences were recorded in
      periodontal parameters between crowns and control teeth. Third-generation
      monolithic zirconia could be a reliable alternative to posterior metal-ceramic
      and second-generation monolithic zirconia posterior crowns.

TI  - Clinical performance of bonded leucite-reinforced glass ceramic inlays and onlays
      after eight years.
PG  - 262-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ceramic inlays and onlays are a tooth colored alternative to metallic 
      restorations. Clinical long-term data are scarce though, especially about inlays 
      and onlays having proximal margins in dentin. The present prospective controlled 
      clinical study evaluated the clinical performance of IPS Empress inlays and
      onlays with cuspal replacements and proximal margins below the cementoenamel
      junction over eight years. METHODS: Ninety six ceramic restorations were placed
      in 34 patients by six dentists. The restorations were bonded with an
      enamel/dentin bonding system (Syntac Classic) and four different resin composite 
      systems. The restorations were assessed after placement by two calibrated
      investigators using modified USPHS codes and criteria at the following time
      periods: baseline, 1,2,4,6 and 8 years. RESULTS: Eight of the 96 restorations
      investigated had to be replaced (failure rate 8%; Kaplan-Meier): Six inlays
      suffered cohesive bulk fractures, two teeth required endodontic treatment. After 
      eight years of clinical service, significant deterioration (Friedman 2-way ANOVA;
      P < 0.05) was found for marginal adaptation of the remaining restorations. 98% of
      the surviving restorations exhibited marginal deficiencies, independent of the
      luting composite. CONCLUSIONS: IPS Empress inlays and onlays demonstrated to be
      successful even in large defects. Neither the absence of enamel margins, nor
      cuspal replacement significantly affected the quality of the restorations.

TI  - Survival rates and complication behaviour of tooth implant-supported, fixed
      dental prostheses: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the survival and complication rates of tooth-implant
      supported fixed dental prostheses (T-I FDPs). SOURCES: An electronic search in
      MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase was conducted using MeSH terms to
      identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or prospective studies with an
      observation period of at least 3 years, including at least 10 participants. STUDY
      SELECTION: Included studies were qualitatively assessed. Survival rates of T-I
      FDPs and implants as well as technical and biological complications were
      obtained. Failure and complication rates were pooled by weighting each rate in
      inverse proportion to its variance. DATA: A total of eight studies were
      considered for qualitative analysis; seven studies with a minimum follow-up of
      five years were included for quantitative analysis. Estimated survival rates of
      T-I FDPs were 90.8% (95% CI: 86.4-93.8%) after five years and 82.5% (95% CI:
      74.7-88.0%) after 10 years. Implant survival estimates were 94.8% (90.9-97.0%)
      and 89.8% (82.7-99.4%) after 5 and 10 years, respectively. From a total of 185
      T-I FDPs, 21 (11.4%) minor and 23 (12.4%) major biological complications were
      observed, whereas 23 (12.4%) minor and three (1.6%) major technical complications
      occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the lack of well-designed studies exceeding a
      10-year follow-up, prognosis for the long -term can hardly be given. Considering 
      the inclusion criteria of this systematic review, T-I FDP-supported fixed dental 
      prostheses show acceptable survival rates after five and 10 years. Rigidly
      constructed T-I FDPs should be preferred. With regard to the available data,
      these conclusions are valid only for three- to four-unit T-I FDPs. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: Tooth-implant supported fixed dental prostheses are a recommendable
      treatment option in partial dentition. Based on the current literature, they
      should be rigidly constructed with a maximum number of four units.

TI  - The success of indirect restorations in posterior teeth: a systematic review of
      the literature.
PG  - 231-40
AB  - AIM: Aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term reliability and effectiveness
      of inlays and onlays in ceramic and composite material, examining scientific
      studies published from 2004 to 2013. The results of this review were analyzed and
      compared with the important literature review proposed by Manhart in 2004.
      METHODS: With this review it was possible to analyze a total sample of 5858 Class
      I and II restorations, made in the posterior region: 5295 ceramic and 563
      composite restorations in 2377 patients. Works were evaluated using USPHS,
      modified USPHS and CDA criteria after a mean observation period of 5.4 years (5.9
      years for ceramic restorations, 2.6 for composite restorations). RESULTS: The
      arithmetic average of success was 94%, higher in ceramic restorations (94.9%)
      than composite materials (91.1%). The weighted average success rate was 95.3%,
      92.8% for composite restorations and 96.3% for ceramic ones. The highest rates of
      success were found in ceramic restorations notwithstanding the longer observation
      period. CONCLUSION: Indirect restorations have a low failure rate and they prove 
      to be an excellent choice in the treatment of both class I and II lesions. During
      the last 6 years, the parameters related to these restorations have improved,
      with a 4% increase of success.

TI  - Survival Rates and Complications for Zirconia-Based Fixed Dental Prostheses in a 
      Period up to 10 Years: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 54-61
LID - 10.1922/EJPRD_01681Stefanescu08 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to methodically review the literature
      concerning the success and survival rates of zirconia fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of MEDLINE, Elsevier and the
      Cochrane Library to identify relevant articles about zirconia FDPs. In order to
      obtain suitable articles, rigorous criteria were applied. The minimum follow-up
      period was five years. RESULTS: From a total of 986 articles identified in the
      first electronic search, only 10 matched the inclusion criteria. A total of 368
      patients with 430 zirconia FDPs were included in this systematic review. The
      survival rate was 89.43% +/- 10.01% and chipping of the veneering ceramic
      occurred in 16.97% of the cases. CONCLUSION: Zirconia-based fixed dental
      prostheses perform reasonably well and can serve as an alternative to
      metal-ceramic fixed dental prostheses.

TI  - A four to six years follow-up of indirect resin composite inlays/onlays.
PG  - 247-51
AB  - The objective of this clinical survival study was to evaluate the performance of 
      indirect resin composite inlays and onlays. Patients were recruited among the
      dental school clientele needing posterior approximal restorations and preferring 
      esthetic restorations. Two clinical teachers and 6 trained students under
      supervision carried out the preparations, made impressions, and prepared stone
      casts. Inlays/onlays from Tetric, Z100, or Maxxim were light-cured and
      transferred to a light oven for secondary curing. At the 4 6 year recall, the
      inlays/onlays were evaluated using slightly modified US Public Health Service
      criteria, bitewing radiographs, and plastic dies based on replica impressions.
      All 25 treated patients with a total of 64 inlays/onlays presented for the
      assessment. The right-censored observation periods ranged from 48 to 75 months,
      with a mean of 59. With the exception of three failed inlays/onlays scored as 'D'
      (2 fractures, 1 caries), i.e. 5%, the majority were classified as successful.
      This was based on 43 'A' (optimal) and 18 'B' (acceptable) ratings, each of which
      represented the lowest rating for each individual restoration. The major reason
      for 'B' ratings was imperfect anatomical form, mostly absence of proximal
      contacts. The present clinical trial demonstrated that inlays/onlays made from
      Tetric, Z100, and Maxxim performed equally well over the 5-year period. Within
      the limits of this study it is concluded that the resin composite inlay/onlay
      technique should be considered as an alternative to direct fillings in the
      approximal posterior region.

TI  - Performance of CAD/CAM monolithic ceramic Implant-supported restorations bonded
      to titanium inserts: A systematic review.
PG  - 139-146
AB  - AIMS: This review assessed the available evidence on the performance of CAD/CAM
      monolithic implant-supported restorations bonded to titanium (Ti) inserts and
      bases, which has become a popular concept. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic
      and manual search of PubMed databases was conducted to identify studies published
      in English between 2000 and 2016 on the performance of monolithic ceramic implant
      restorations with Ti inserts. RESULTS: The initial search revealed 505 titles.
      Full-text screening was carried out for 70 studies, yielding 25 articles that met
      the inclusion criteria. No clinical studies could be identified regarding the
      performance of monolithic ceramic restorations bonded to Ti inserts. Laboratory
      studies on selected aspects and studies on similar prosthetic designs indicate
      that Ti inserts improve the overall fracture strength of ceramic abutments and
      crowns, protect the implant connection from wear, and offer a better marginal fit
      when compared with all-ceramic abutments. CONCLUSIONS: While laboratory studies
      and evaluations of similar designs indicated promising outcomes, clinical studies
      that evaluate the performance of CAD/CAM monolithic implant-supported
      restorations bonded to Ti inserts and bases are needed.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The introduction of polymer-infiltrated ceramic network
      (PICN) materials may provide more options for dentists in restoring short
      clinical crowns and extensively damaged posterior teeth, but clinical data for
      their performance are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical study was to
      compare the 3-year performance and survival rates of PICN material with those of 
      conservative ceramic onlay restorations for endodontically treated posterior
      teeth using the CEREC AC chair-side system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 101 
      onlay restorations of endodontically treated posterior teeth using the CEREC AC
      chair-side system were provided in 93 participants. The 101 teeth were divided
      into 2 groups: Vita Enamic group and Vitablocs Mark II group. Using the modified 
      US Public Health Service quality evaluation system, 2 calibrated evaluators
      examined the performance of the onlay restorations over 3 years. The Kaplan-Meier
      method was adopted to analyze the survival rate of restorations (alpha=.05). The 
      log rank test was used to compare the survival rates of the 2 groups. The Fisher 
      exact test was performed to detect differences in the success rates for
      extensively damaged teeth and short clinical crown restorations between the 2
      groups. The Silness and Loe gingival index was also recorded. RESULTS: The
      restoration survival rates in the 2 groups were 97.0% (Vita Enamic) and 90.7%
      (Vitablocs Mark II) (P>.05). Five failures were recorded (4.95%). These failures 
      were caused by restoration debonding (60%), ceramic fractures (20%), and tooth
      fractures (20%). There were no significant differences between the success rates 
      of restoring extensively damaged teeth and short clinical crowns between the 2
      groups (P>.05). The periodontal condition of 25% of participants was improved 3
      years after the onlay restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Onlay restorations of
      endodontically treated posterior teeth with Vita Enamic using the CEREC AC
      chair-side system are clinically promising prosthodontic alternatives, with a
      survival rate of 97.0% after 3 years. More research is needed to verify the
      results of this study.

TI  - A systematic review of the survival and complication rates of implant-supported
      fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) after a mean observation period of at least 5
      years.
PG  - 22-38
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0501.2012.02546.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the 5- and
      10-year survival of implant-supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) and to
      describe the incidence of biological and technical complications. METHODS: An
      electronic Medline search complemented by manual searching was conducted to
      identify prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case series on FDPs
      with a mean follow-up time of at least 5 years. Patients had to have been
      examined clinically at the follow-up visit. Failure and complication rates were
      analyzed using standard and random-effects Poisson regression models to obtain
      summary estimates of 5-year and 10-year survival and complication rates. RESULTS:
      The updated search provided 979 titles and 257 abstracts. Full-text analysis was 
      performed for 90 articles resulting in a total 32 studies that met the inclusion 
      criteria. Meta-analysis of these studies indicated an estimated survival of
      implants supporting FDPs of 95.6% after 5 years and 93.1% after 10 years. When
      machined surface implants were excluded from the analysis and only rough surface 
      implants included, the survival rate increased to 97.2% after 5 years. The
      survival rate of implant-supported FDPs was 95.4% after 5 years and 80.1% after
      10 years of function. When the analysis was done exclusively for metal-ceramic
      FDPs, hence the old gold-acrylic FDPs were excluded, the survival rate increased 
      significantly. The survival rate of metal-ceramic implant-supported FDPs was
      96.4% after 5 years and 93.9% after 10 years. Only 66.4% of the patients were
      free of any complications after 5 years. The most frequent complications over the
      5-year observation period were fractures of the veneering material (13.5%),
      peri-implantitis and soft tissue complications (8.5%), loss of access hole
      restoration (5.4%), abutment or screw loosening (5.3%), and loss of retention of 
      cemented FDPs (4.7%). CONCLUSION: It may be concluded that implant-supported
      fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) are a safe and predictable treatment method with
      high survival rates. However, biological and technical complications were
      frequent (33.6%). To minimize the incidence of complications, dental
      professionals should make great effort in choosing reliable components and
      materials for implant-supported FDPs and the patients should be placed in
      well-structured maintenance system after treatment.

TI  - A systematic review of the survival and complication rates of fixed partial
      dentures (FPDs) after an observation period of at least 5 years.
PG  - 625-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the 5- and
      10-year survival of implant supported fixed partial dentures (FPDs) and to
      describe the incidence of biological and technical complications. METHODS: An
      electronic MEDLINE search complemented by manual searching was conducted to
      identify prospective and retrospective cohort studies on FPDs with a mean
      follow-up time of at least 5 years. Patients had to have been examined clinically
      at the follow-up visit. Assessment of the identified studies and data abstraction
      was performed independently by two reviewers. Failure and complication rates were
      analyzed using random-effects Poisson regression models to obtain summary
      estimates of 5- and 10-year survival proportions. RESULTS: The search provided
      3844 titles and 560 abstracts. Full-text analysis was performed for 176 articles 
      resulting in 21 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of these
      studies indicated an estimated survival of implants in implant-supported FPDs of 
      95.4% (95 percent confidence interval (95% CI): 93.9-96.5%) after 5 and 92.8%
      (95% CI: 90-94.8%) after 10 years. The survival rate of FPDs supported by
      implants was 95% (95% CI: 92.2-96.8%) after 5 and 86.7% (95% CI: 82.8-89.8%)
      after 10 years of function. Only 61.3% (95% CI: 55.3-66.8%) of the patients were 
      free of any complications after 5 years. Peri-implantitis and soft tissue
      complications occurred in 8.6% (95% CI: 5.1-14.1%) of FPDs after 5 years.
      Technical complications included implant fractures, connection-related and
      suprastructure-related complications. The cumulative incidence of implant
      fractures after 5 years was 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1-1.2%). After 5 years, the
      cumulative incidence of connection-related complications (screw loosening or
      fracture) was 7.3% and 14% for suprastructure-related complications (veneer and
      framework fracture). CONCLUSION: Despite a high survival of FPDs, biological and 
      technical complications are frequent. This, in turn, means that substantial
      amounts of chair time have to be accepted by the clinician following the
      incorporation of implant-supported FPDs. More studies with follow-up times of 10 
      and more years are needed as only few studies have described the long-term
      outcomes.

TI  - A four-year prospective clinical evaluation of zirconia and metal-ceramic
      posterior fixed dental prostheses.
PG  - 451-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the survival rates and biologic and
      technical complications of three-unit metal-ceramic posterior fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) with those obtained with zirconia frameworks. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Thirty-seven patients in need of 40 three-unit posterior FDPs were
      included in this study. The FDPs were randomly assigned to 20 zirconia and 20
      metal-ceramic restorations. Abutment preparation guidelines consisted of a
      1-mm-wide circumferential chamfer, axial reduction of 1 mm, and occlusal
      reduction of 1.5 to 2 mm. At baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years after cementation,
      success of both types of restorations was evaluated. The restorations were
      assessed using the California Dental Association's assessment system. Periodontal
      parameters were assessed by determining the Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index
      (GI), Marginal Index (MI), and pocket depth of the abutment and control teeth.
      Statistical analysis was performed by applying Wilcoxon rank sum and Wilcoxon
      signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Patients were examined after a mean observation
      period of 50 +/- 2.4 months. The survival rates for metal-ceramic and zirconia
      restorations were 100% and 95%, respectively. One biologic complication in a
      zirconia FDP was observed at the 3-year follow-up. No fractures of the zirconia
      or metal frameworks were observed. Restorations from both groups were assessed as
      satisfactory. Minor chipping of the veneering ceramic was observed in 2 zirconia 
      FDPs after 4 years. No significant differences were observed between abutment and
      contralateral teeth for either type of restoration or within the groups with
      regard to PI, GI, and pocket depth. CONCLUSION: Zirconia-based FDPs demonstrated 
      a similar survival rate to metal-ceramic FDPs after medium-term clinical use.

TI  - Clinical and patient-reported outcomes of zirconia-based implant fixed dental
      prostheses: Results of a prospective case series 5 years after implant placement.
PG  - 91-99
LID - 10.1111/clr.13072 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and patient-reported outcome of all-ceramic
      zirconia implant supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) 5 years after implant
      installation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients were treated with two
      terminally placed one-piece zirconia implants for a three-unit FDP each. The FDPs
      consisted of a CAD/CAM-fabricated zirconia framework over-pressed with a
      fluor-apatite veneering ceramic and were adhesively cemented. Survival and
      success were assessed by applying modified US Public Health Service (USPHS)
      criteria and preparation of Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots. Alpha and Bravo ratings were
      accepted for success (among others including small area veneer chippings and
      occlusal roughness), whereas Charlie ratings allowing for intra-oral correction
      (e.g., polishing) were accepted for survival. Furthermore, patient-reported
      outcome measures (PROMs) were analyzed with the help of visual analogue scales
      (VAS). Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test (USPHS criteria) and linear mixed 
      models (PROMs) were used to evaluate time effects on response variables. RESULTS:
      All patients were available 61.8 +/- 1.1 months after implant installation (53.6 
      +/- 3.1 months after final prosthesis insertion). FDP survival was 100%.
      Significant incidence of veneer chipping (p = .0096) and occlusal roughness (p = 
      .0019) was observed. Charlie rated extent of both phenomena resulted in a KM
      success estimate of 38.5% (95% CI: 14.1%-62.8%; seven FDPs with obvious
      roughness, three of them with extended veneer chipping). Compared with the
      pre-treatment assessments (30%-81% of satisfaction), all surveys at prosthetic
      delivery showed significantly improved VAS scores (66%-93%; p </= .038), except
      for speech (p = .341). Concerning function, esthetics and self-esteem, no
      decrease in satisfaction could be observed until the end of follow-up (90%-96%; p
      >/= .057), whereas perception of sense (92%) and speech (95%) increased over time
      (p </= .030). Occurrence of technical complications did not correlate with
      patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Bi-layered FDPs made from
      zirconia/fluor-apatite highly satisfied patients but showed significant incidence
      of technical complications.

      Prostheses: A 3-Year Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 259-64
LID - 10.11607/ijp.4504 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this randomized clinical study was to compare the 3-year
      clinical outcome of metal-ceramic fixed dental prostheses (MC-FDPs) and zirconia 
      all-ceramic fixed dental prostheses (AC-FDPs) replacing a posterior tooth.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 34 patients with a missing posterior tooth
      were randomly chosen to receive either a MC-FDP (n = 17) or an AC-FDP (n = 17).
      The FDPs were evaluated at baseline and yearly until 3 years after cementation.
      They were assessed using the California Dental Association assessment system.
      Periodontal parameters were measured at the abutment teeth, and the contralateral
      teeth served as control. The statistical unit was the FDP/patient. RESULTS: The
      survival rates for MC-FDPs and AC-FDPs were 100%. The success rate was 76% and
      71% for MC-FDPs and AC-FDPs, respectively. Three technical complications were
      observed in the MC-FDP group and five in the AC-FDP group, all chipping fractures
      of the ceramic veneer. Furthermore, one biologic complication in the MC-FDP group
      (an apical lesion) was observed. No framework fractures occurred. All patients
      had optimal oral hygiene and showed no bleeding on periodontal probing at any of 
      the recalls. Only minor changes in the periodontal parameters were observed
      during the 3 years of observation. CONCLUSIONS: Three-unit posterior MC-FDPs and 
      AC-FDPs showed similar high survival rates and acceptable success rates after 3
      years of function, and ceramic veneer chipping fracture was the most frequent
      complication for both types of restorations.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to systematically review the existing literature to
      assess the clinical survival and success of PICN and ZLS indirect restorations as
      the clinical evidence for them remains lacking. PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Cochrane 
      Library, Web of Science, LILACs, and SciElo databases were searched from 1
      January 2000 to 1 February 2021. Clinical trials and cohort studies published in 
      English were included while case studies, case series, and in vitro studies were 
      excluded. Results were analyzed qualitatively and a meta-analysis using a random 
      effects model was performed. A strength of recommendation taxonomy (SORT)
      analysis was conducted and risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the
      Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Cochrane RoB tools. An electronic search through the
      databases yielded 2454 articles, of which 825 remained after duplicate removal.
      Five studies investigating PICN and four investigating ZLS indirect restorations 
      remained after assessing for eligibility. The overall survival rate of PICN over 
      1 year was 99.6% and 99.2% over 2 years. The overall survival rate of ZLS over 1 
      year was 99%. The main mode of failure for both materials was catastrophic
      fracture. One study had a high RoB, four had a moderate RoB, and four had a low
      RoB. Both materials demonstrated moderate strength of recommendation at a level 2
      evidence for all studies based on SORT analysis. PICN and ZLS show promising
      short-term clinical performance as full and partial coverage indirect
      restorations, but longer follow-up studies are required to confirm their
      long-term performance.

TI  - Porcelain versus composite inlays/onlays: effects of mechanical loads on stress
      distribution, adhesion, and crown flexure.
PG  - 543-55
AB  - This study used 2-D finite element modeling to simulate cuspal flexure and
      stresses at the surface and tooth-restoration interface of a restored maxillary
      molar using three restorative materials; the influence of four inlay/onlay
      preparation configurations on stress distribution within the complex was also
      investigated. A buccolingual cross-section of an intact molar was digitized and
      used to create 2-D models restored with different restorative materials
      (feldspathic porcelain, high- and low-elastic modulus composites) and tooth
      preparations (small and large inlays, small and large onlays). Two simulated 25-N
      oblique loads were applied to the cusps. The tangential stress for each finite
      element node located at the tooth surface, interfacial stress, and relative
      cuspal flexure were analyzed. All materials and tooth preparations exhibited
      similar surface tangential stress patterns, with a definite compressive area at
      the external cusp ridges, a tensile zone at the occlusal surface, and compression
      stress peaks at the CEJ. The low-elastic modulus composite showed reduced tensile
      stresses at its surface but increased tension at the dentin-adhesive interface
      when compared to ceramics. All types of onlays demonstrated a majority of
      compressive interfacial stresses, while inlays showed a majority of tensile
      stresses. The interfacial tension at the dentin level increased with the
      flexibility of the restorative material. Only the large ceramic onlay displayed
      almost pure compression at the interface. Composite-restored teeth exhibited
      increased crown flexure, while porcelain-restored teeth showed increased crown
      stiffness. Porcelain inlays/onlays featured more detrimental stresses at the
      occlusal surface but better potential protection against debonding at the
      dentin-restoration interface compared to composite inlays/onlays. Ceramic
      onlays/overlays seem to represent an effective answer to restore severely damaged
      posterior teeth.

TI  - Tooth substance removal for ceramic single crown materials-an in vitro
      comparison.
PG  - 3359-3366
LID - 10.1007/s00784-018-2753-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the tooth structure
      removal required for currently available ceramic crown materials. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Ninety typodont teeth (60 incisors, 30 molars) were assigned to nine
      study groups. The teeth were digitized, weighed with a high-precision balance,
      and fixed in carriers in identical alignment. Full-crown restorations were
      prepared according to material-specific guidelines for monolithic zirconia (MZ), 
      polymer-infiltrated ceramics (PIC), buccally veneered zirconia (BVZ), feldspathic
      ceramics (FC), fully veneered zirconia (FVZ), and lithium disilicate (LD). Tooth 
      structure removal was assessed by weighing the teeth before and after
      preparation. Coronal volume loss was analyzed statistically by use of one-way
      ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey HSD tests with alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: Mean tooth
      structure removal for incisors was 42% (SD 2%) for MZ, 46% (SD 1%) for PIC, 50%
      (SD 2%) for BVZ, 57% (SD 1%) for FC, 57% (SD 2%) for FVZ, and 59% (SD 2%) for LD.
      Mean tooth structure removal for molars was 21% (SD 2%) for MZ, 31% (SD 1%) for
      PIC, and 35% (SD 1%) for LD. Inter-group differences were statistically
      significant, except for between FC and FVZ. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation of full
      ceramic crowns for restoration-free teeth is an invasive procedure. Selecting the
      ceramic material can, however, reduce loss of tooth structure substantially.
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Monolithic zirconia is the least invasive material for the
      preparation of incisor and molar ceramic single crowns. Prescribing buccally
      veneered instead of fully veneered zirconia reduces preparation invasiveness
      significantly.

AB  - Ceramic inlays and onlays have significant aesthetic and biologic benefits.
      Long-term clinical studies on the success of ceramic inlays and onlays, however, 
      provide only limited observation periods, considering that such restorations rely
      on current and constantly improving adhesive bonding techniques. Alternative
      materials, such as cast-gold restorations, have a long history of documented
      clinical success, which should be taken into consideration when making decisions 
      on proper restorative material selection.

TI  - Outcomes of root canal treatment and restoration, implant-supported single
      crowns, fixed partial dentures, and extraction without replacement: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 285-311
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Dentists and patients are regularly confronted by a
      difficult treatment question: should a tooth be saved through root canal
      treatment and restoration (RCT), be extracted without any tooth replacement, be
      replaced with a fixed partial denture (FPD) or an implant-supported single crown 
      (ISC)? PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the
      outcomes, benefits, and harms of endodontic care and restoration compared to
      extraction and placement of ISCs, FPDs, or extraction without tooth replacement. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Searches performed in MEDLINE, Cochrane, and EMBASE
      databases were enriched by hand searches, citation mining, and expert
      recommendation. Evidence tables were developed following quality and inclusion
      criteria assessment. Pooled and weighted mean success and survival rates, with
      associated confidence intervals, were calculated for single implant crowns, fixed
      partial dentures, and initial nonsurgical root canal treatments. Data related to 
      extraction without tooth replacement and psychosocial outcomes were evaluated by 
      a narrative review due to literature limitations. RESULTS: The 143 selected
      studies varied considerably in design, success definition, assessment methods,
      operator type, and sample size. Direct comparison of treatment types was
      extremely rare. Limited psychosocial data revealed the traumatic effect of loss
      of visible teeth. Economic data were largely absent. Success rates for ISCs were 
      higher than for RCTs and FPDs, respectively; however, success criteria differed
      greatly among treatment types, rendering direct comparison of success rates
      futile. Long-term survival rates for ISCs and RCTs were similar and superior to
      those for FPDs. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of comparative studies with similar outcomes
      criteria with comparable time intervals limited comparison of these treatments.
      ISC and RCT treatments resulted in superior long-term survival, compared to FPDs.
      Limited data suggested that extraction without replacement resulted in inferior
      psychosocial outcomes compared to alternatives. Long-term, prospective clinical
      trials with large sample sizes and clearly defined outcomes criteria are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: the purpose of the present prospective trial was to evaluate the
      clinical performance of posterior 3-unit zirconia-based fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs) after 14 years of clinical function. METHODS: thirty-seven patients
      needing to replace either premolars or molars were involved and 48 FDPs were
      fabricated (Procera Zirconia, Nobel Biocare AB). Frameworks with a9mm(2) cross
      section of the connectors and 0.6mm minimum thickness of the retainers were made 
      by means of Procera Forte CAD-CAM System (Nobel Biocare AB). The patients were
      recalled after 6 and 12 months and then yearly up to a total follow-up of 14
      years. Two independent survival curves for patients wearing 1 or 2 FDPs were
      calculated by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis and a log-rank test was performed in
      order to compare these curves. The United States Public Health Service criteria
      were used to examine technical and esthetic outcomes. The biological examination 
      was performed evaluating plaque control, pocket depth, attachment level, bleeding
      on probing at both abutments and contralateral teeth and evaluated by means of
      the Wilcoxon test (p<0.05) between the baseline and the 14-year follow-up.
      RESULTS: descriptive statistics resulted in 91 % and 99 % cumulative survival
      rates for patients wearing 1 and 2 FDPs, respectively. There were no significant 
      differences in periodontal parameters between control and test teeth. Both
      function and esthetic results were successful for FDPs over a 14-year follow-up
      period. CONCLUSIONS: the results of this prospective clinical study confirmed the
      effectiveness of zirconia as a clinical option to fabricate short-span posterior 
      FDPs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: within the limitations of the present prospective
      clinical study, zirconia-based three-unit fixed dental prostheses perform

TI  - Current status of zirconia-based all-ceramic restorations fabricated by the
      digital veneering technique: a comprehensive review.
PG  - 217-230
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Delamination and chipping are major complications of veneering
      material on zirconia-based all-ceramic restorations. The digital veneering
      technique was introduced to overcome these complications as both zirconia
      frameworks and veneering ceramic are fabricated by computer-aided
      design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM). The aim of this review is to
      report all articles that evaluate zirconia-based all-ceramic restorations
      fabricated by the digital veneering technique. Three different digital veneering 
      techniques were detected: the Lava DVS Digital Veneering System (3M ESPE), the
      Rapid Layer Technology (Vita Zahnfabrik), and the CAD-on technique (Ivoclar
      Vivadent). There are also some modifications of these techniques in the
      literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this review, a comprehensive literature
      search was conducted. Detected studies are reported according to fracture
      resistance, flexural strength, wear performance, shear bond strength,
      microtensile bond strength, mechanical performance of restorations on implant
      abutments, marginal fit, color reproducibility, and clinical success for all
      types of digital veneering techniques. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical
      framework design and digital veneering using lithium disilicate and fusion
      porcelain might decrease the risk of chipping and delamination of veneering
      ceramic on zirconia-supported all-ceramic restorations. However, this result is
      mainly supported by in vitro studies. More clinical studies with a large sample
      size, longer follow-up period, and different fixed dental prosthesis designs are 
      needed.

TI  - Longevity of restorations in posterior teeth and reasons for failure.
PG  - 45-64
AB  - PURPOSE: This article compiles a survey on the longevity of restorations in
      stress-bearing posterior cavities and assesses possible reasons for failure.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dental literature predominantly of the last decade was
      reviewed for longitudinal, controlled clinical studies and retrospective
      cross-sectional studies of posterior restorations. Only studies investigating the
      clinical performance of restorations in permanent teeth were included. Longevity 
      and annual failure rates of amalgam, direct composite restorations, glass
      ionomers and derivative products, composite and ceramic inlays, and cast gold
      restorations were determined for Class I and II cavities. RESULTS: Annual failure
      rates in posterior stress-bearing restorations are: 0% to 7% for amalgam
      restorations, 0% to 9% for direct composites, 1.4% to 14.4% for glass ionomers
      and derivatives, 0% to 11.8% for composite inlays, 0% to 7.5% for ceramic
      restorations, 0% to 4.4% for CAD/CAM ceramic restorations, and 0% to 5.9% for
      cast gold inlays and onlays. CONCLUSION: Longevity of dental restorations is
      dependent upon many different factors that are related to materials, the patient,
      and the dentist. The principal reasons for failure were secondary caries,
      fracture, marginal deficiencies, wear, and postoperative sensitivity. A
      distinction must be made between factors causing early failures and those that
      are responsible for restoration loss after several years of service.

TI  - Strength estimation of different designs of ceramic inlays and onlays in molars
      based on the Tsai-Wu failure criterion.
PG  - 89-100
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Successful restoration of large molar defects is a serious 
      clinical problem. Studies on the strength of teeth restored with ceramic
      restorations of various designs have provided conflicting results. PURPOSE: The
      purpose of this study was to determine the shapes of large MOD ceramic
      restorations in molars most likely to prevent failure and to produce a favorable 
      distribution of contact stresses between the cement and teeth during mastication.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed using a finite element analysis
      with contact elements. Eight 2-dimensional models of mandibular first molars with
      the following designs of MOD ceramic restorations were created: an inlay with a
      butt joint margin, an inlay with a beveled margin, an onlay with a butt joint
      margin, and an onlay with a rounded shoulder margin. The restorations had 3-mm or
      5-mm isthmus widths. Models of opposing maxillary crowns were also developed.
      Computational simulation of mastication of boluses in the frontal plane was
      conducted, during which the stresses occurring in the ceramic restorations,
      cement, and tooth structure were calculated. The Tsai-Wu failure criterion was
      used to evaluate the strength of the materials. Contact stresses at the adhesive 
      interface between the tooth structure and resin cement around these restorations 
      were analyzed. RESULTS: According to the Tsai-Wu failure criterion, the margin of
      the beveled inlay and the surrounding tissue could be damaged during masticatory 
      simulation. At the junction of the butt joint margin inlay and enamel, contact
      tensile stresses appeared. The lowest inverse of the Tsai-Wu strength ratio index
      appeared in the onlay with a rounded shoulder margin. At the adhesive interfaces 
      around margins of large onlays, compressive contact stresses occurred.
      CONCLUSIONS: For the large molar MOD ceramic restorations tested, the lowest
      values of the inverse of the Tsai-Wu strength ratio index and a favorable
      distribution of contact stresses between restoration and tissues appeared in the 
      onlay with a rounded shoulder margin.

TI  - Anterior all-ceramic superstructures: chance or risk?
PG  - 217-27
LID - 10.3290/j.qi.a33268 [doi]
AB  - The use of zirconia abutments for single-tooth restorations is well documented
      and supported by clinical studies with observational periods of up to 5 years.
      However, data for fixed partial dentures (FPDs) on all-ceramic abutments are
      lacking. Therefore, this indication cannot yet be generally recommended. Based on
      the available clinical studies, it can be assumed that the treatment results for 
      anterior restorations can be improved by using all-ceramic abutments, especially 
      in situations with a reduced thickness of the peri-implant soft tissues (< 2 mm).
      Zirconia abutments for single-tooth restorations can be restored with
      glass-ceramic crowns on a lithium-disilicate base or crowns with oxide-ceramic
      structures (alumina or zirconia). If the restorations are cemented adhesively,
      then all of the cement residues must be carefully removed. Superstructures based 
      on zirconia ceramics can be removed to a certain degree if they are cemented
      temporarily or screwfixed with directly veneered abutments. However, prior to
      providing a general recommendation for temporary cementation or screw-fixation of
      all-ceramic superstructures, additional clinical data are needed.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of ceramic inlays compared to composite restorations.
PG  - 263-72
LID - 10.2341/08-95 [doi]
AB  - This study compared the clinical performance of indirectly manufactured ceramic
      Evopress inlays with those of directly placed, fine particle hybrid Filtek Z250
      composite restorations in posterior teeth. From January 2000 to October 2003, 109
      patients received 264 Evopress (Wegold) ceramic inlays and 68 patients received
      145 Filtek Z250 (3M ESPE) composite restorations in a dental office. Two-hundred 
      and fifty ceramic inlays (95%) and 135 composite restorations (93%) were
      re-examined up to 57 months after placement. Modified USPHS criteria were used
      for the study. The worst finding of all the assessments was the overall
      assessment of individual restorations. On the basis of these criteria, 220 (88%) 
      Evopress ceramic inlays were assessed as Alpha at the time of clinical
      re-examination, 26 (10%) were judged Beta and four ceramic inlays (2%) were rated
      Delta in the re-examination interval and thus categorized as failures. At the
      time of re-examination, 91 of the 135 composite restorations (67%) were judged
      Alpha, 36 restorations (26%) were rated Beta and three restorations (2%) were
      judged Charlie. Five restorations (4%) were categorized as failures (Delta). In
      two cases, there were marginal gap formations; there were also two cases of
      secondary caries after 28 and 35 months, as well as a fracture after 13 months.
      According to Kaplan and Meier, the survival rate after 57 months was 94% for
      ceramic inlays and 93% for composite restorations. The log rank test showed no
      significant differences in the survival curves. The current study showed that
      indirectly manufactured Evopress ceramic inlays performed better than direct
      Filtek Z250 composite restorations in marginal adaptation, color match and
      anatomic form. However, with regard to survival probability, there was no
      significant difference.

TI  - Fracture resistance of implant- supported monolithic crowns cemented to zirconia 
      hybrid-abutments: zirconia-based crowns vs. lithium disilicate crowns.
PG  - 65-72
LID - 10.4047/jap.2018.10.1.65 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the fracture
      resistance under chewing simulation of implant-supported posterior restorations
      (crowns cemented to hybrid-abutments) made of different all-ceramic materials.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Monolithic zirconia (MZr) and monolithic lithium
      disilicate (MLD) crowns for mandibular first molar were fabricated using
      computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing technology and then cemented
      to zirconia hybrid-abutments (Ti-based). Each group was divided into two
      subgroups (n=10): (A) control group, crowns were subjected to single load to
      fracture; (B) test group, crowns underwent chewing simulation using multiple
      loads for 1.2 million cycles at 1.2 Hz with simultaneous thermocycling between 5 
      and 55. Data was statistically analyzed with one-way ANOVA and a Post-Hoc test.
      RESULTS: All tested crowns survived chewing simulation resulting in 100% survival
      rate. However, wear facets were observed on all the crowns at the occlusal
      contact point. Fracture load of monolithic lithium disilicate crowns was
      statistically significantly lower than that of monolithic zirconia crowns. Also, 
      fracture load was significantly reduced in both of the all-ceramic materials
      after exposure to chewing simulation and thermocycling. Crowns of all test groups
      exhibited cohesive fracture within the monolithic crown structure only, and no
      abutment fractures or screw loosening were observed. CONCLUSION: When supported
      by implants, monolithic zirconia restorations cemented to hybrid abutments
      withstand masticatory forces. Also, fatigue loading accompanied by simultaneous
      thermocycling significantly reduces the strength of both of the all-ceramic
      materials. Moreover, further research is needed to define potentials, limits, and
      long-term serviceability of the materials and hybrid abutments.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the survival and
      complication rates of inlay-retainer fixed dental prostheses (IRFDPs).
      DATA/SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, and
      Cochrane Library databases in English and time filters (articles published from
      1960) were used. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trails (RCTs), controlled
      clinical trials (CCTs) and prospective cohort studies on IRFDPs with a mean
      follow-up period of at least 2 years were included. Among 501 screened articles, 
      one RCT and ten prospective cohort studies were included in this study. Of the
      included studies, information on failure and complications was independently
      extracted by two reviewers in duplicate. The failure and complication rates of
      IRFDPs were pooled with a random effect model and Poisson regression was applied 
      to further investigate the influence of framework materials. The estimated 3- and
      5-year survival rates of IRFDPs were 92.6% (95% CI: 85.8-97.6%) and 87.9% (95%
      CI: 77.4-96.1%), respectively. Debonding, fracture, dentine hypersensitivity and 
      secondary caries were primary complications. The estimated 5-year rates of
      debonding, veneer fracture and secondary caries were 5.3%, 15.2% and 2.7%,
      respectively. Additionally, fiber-reinforced composite IRFDPs exhibited a lower
      incidence of debonding and caries with a higher rate of veneer fracture compared 
      with metal-based and all-ceramic IRFDPs (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with
      conventional fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) and implant-supported single crowns
      (ISCs), IRFDPs exhibited an acceptable 3-year survival rate but higher
      complication rates of debonding and veneer fracture. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
      IRFDPs can be recommended as viable short- or middle-term minimally invasive
      alternatives to short-span conventional FDPs and ISCs, while the clinical outcome
      of IRFDPs as long-term definitive restorations still calls for further research. 
      The indications of IRFDPs should be strictly controlled and monitored.

TI  - All-ceramic inlay-retained fixed dental prostheses for replacing posterior
      missing teeth: A systematic review.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the current status of all-ceramic inlay-retained fixed
      dental prostheses (CIR-FDPs) for the replacement of posterior teeth. STUDY
      SELECTION: Screening of titles and abstracts, full-text analysis for inclusion
      eligibility, quality assessment, data extraction and evaluation of the scientific
      evidence were performed independently by two reviewers. The electronic databases 
      MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and
      Compludoc were searched with no restriction to publication date or language. The 
      quality of the studies was evaluated through: the original 'QDP' ('Questionnaire 
      for selecting articles on Dental Prostheses') (for research papers); the
      'Guidelines for managing overviews' of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group 
      (for reviews); the Cochrane risk of bias tool; and the GRADE scale for grading
      scientific evidence. RESULTS: This review started with 4942 articles, which were 
      narrowed down to 23 according to the selection criteria. The data was not
      statistically treated because of the heterogeneity of the studies. Zirconia-based
      CIR-FDPs may be recommended for restoring posterior single missing teeth,
      although the prosthesis/tooth bonded interface has yet to be improved. The
      addition of lateral wings to the classical inlay preparation seems promising. The
      weakest parts of CIR-FDPs are the connectors and retainers, while caries and
      endodontic problems are the most common biological complications. The fabrication
      of CIR-FDPs with monolithic zirconia may eliminate chipping problems.
      CONCLUSIONS: A three-unit CIR-FDP is a viable treatment option for replacing a
      posterior missing tooth. Appropriate case selection, abutment preparation and
      luting procedures may be decisive for clinical success.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the clinical long-term outcome of 3- to
      6-unit fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) made of hot isostatic pressed (HIP)
      zirconia frameworks, veneered with a synthetic sintering glass-ceramic. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: A total of 27 different restorations were cemented in 21 patients.
      FDPs were examined with regard to biological and technical
      complications/failures. Additionally, clinical quality was assessed based on (i) 
      the California Dental Association (CDA) criteria, (ii) the patient's viewpoint
      according to Hickel, and (iii) periodontal parameters. Descriptive statistics
      were computed. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used for the survival and
      chipping-free rates. Wilcoxon signed ranks test (ordinal/continuous data) or the 
      McNemar test (binary data) was used to describe the periodontal outcome of
      abutment teeth versus that of the respective control teeth. RESULTS: After a mean
      observation period of 10.0 +/- 2.1 years, the dataset comprised 15 patients with 
      20 (mainly posterior) FDPs. The 10-year survival rate and 10-year chipping-free
      rate were 95.0% (CI 86.0-100%) and 78.8% (CI 62.2-99.7%), respectively.
      Evaluation based on the CDA criteria yielded satisfactory (excellent or
      acceptable) results for all categories. This was also confirmed by the high level
      of patient satisfaction. The periodontal health of tissues adjacent to the study 
      teeth was clinically acceptable, but inferior to the ones of control teeth.
      CONCLUSIONS: FDPs made from CAD/CAM-fabricated HIP zirconia ceramic frameworks
      have a favorable survival rate. However, because damage to the surface texture
      showed a disproportionate increase after long-term usage, additional long-term
      studies are required. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The outstanding mechanical properties
      of zirconia-based systems have contributed to the belief that all-ceramics are a 
      reliable material for prosthetic restorations. However, only long-term reports
      (such as this one) provide more detailed information on actual clinical efficacy.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Little is known about the clinical performance of ceramic
      cantilever fixed dental prostheses on natural teeth. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      randomized controlled pilot study was to evaluate the clinical performance of
      ceramic and metal ceramic cantilever fixed dental prostheses (CFDPs) after 3
      years of service. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one participants were randomly
      allocated to 2 treatment groups. Participants in the ceramic (ZC) group (n=11)
      each received 1 CFDP made of yttria-stabilized, tetragonal zirconia polycrystal; 
      the others (n=10) were fitted with a metal ceramic (MC) CFDP. All CFDPs were
      retained by 2 complete crown abutments and replaced 1 tooth. The clinical target 
      variables were survival, incidence of complications, probing pocket depth (PPD), 
      probing attachment level (PAL), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and
      esthetic performance as rated by the participants. The United States Public
      Health Service (USPHS) criteria were used to evaluate chipping, retention, color,
      marginal integrity, and secondary caries. Descriptive statistics and
      nonparametric analyses were applied to the target variables in the 2 groups. The 
      esthetic performance of the CFDPs was also visualized by using a pyramid
      comparison. RESULTS: The overall survival of the CFDPs was 100% in both groups.
      During the 3-year study, 6 clinically relevant complications requiring aftercare 
      were observed among 5 participants (4 in the ZC group and 2 in the MC group).
      Changes in the PI, GI, PPD, and PAL of the abutment teeth were similar for both
      groups (P>.05). The participants regarded the esthetic performance of ZC-CFDPs
      and MC-CFDPs as satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Within the 3-year observation period, 
      the clinical performance of MC-FDPs and ZC-FDPs was acceptable. More extensive
      research with larger sample sizes is encouraged, however, to confirm the
      evaluation of the survival of Y-TZP hand-veneered cantilever FPDs.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Monolithic zirconia has excellent mechanical and biologic
      properties. However, evidence of the clinical properties of implant-supported
      monolithic zirconia prostheses is limited. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      retrospective clinical study was to compare the peri-implant marginal bone
      changes of metal-ceramic and monolithic zirconia single crowns in the posterior
      region after prosthetic loading. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 224
      participants treated with 327 implants restored with either metal-ceramic or
      monolithic zirconia single crowns in the posterior region between 2012 and 2016
      were included in this study. Clinical outcomes, including the plaque index,
      peri-implant probing depth, and bleeding on probing, were recorded, and the
      marginal bone level was recorded by using the panoramic radiographs obtained at
      implant placement, second-stage surgery, and the most recent follow-up visit. The
      included parameters were analyzed with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests
      (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 30.4 months, and the cumulative
      survival rate of implants was 100% and that of the prostheses was 99.1%. The
      plaque index was 0.46 in the metal-ceramic group, which was significantly higher 
      (P<.05) than 0.37 in the monolithic zirconia group. However, no significant
      differences (P>.05) were observed in peri-implant probing depth and bleeding on
      probing between the 2 groups. The marginal bone level at implant placement,
      second-stage surgery, and the most recent follow-up visit was above the implant
      platform in both the metal-ceramic and monolithic zirconia groups. The marginal
      bone changes of the metal-ceramic group was 0.31 mm in the healing period and
      0.38 mm in the prosthetic loading period, while in the monolithic zirconia group,
      it was 0.25 mm in the healing period and 0.43 mm in the prosthetic loading
      period; no significant differences (P>.05) were observed between the 2 groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The peri-implant marginal bone level change was comparable after
      prosthetic loading for metal-ceramic and monolithic zirconia single crowns,
      although monolithic zirconia was associated with reduced plaque.

TI  - A 1-year randomised controlled trial comparing zirconia versus metal-ceramic
      implant supported single-tooth restorations.
PG  - 347-61
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the biological, technical and aesthetic outcomes of single
      implant-supported all-ceramic versus metal-ceramic crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Thirty-six patients with premolar agenesis were randomly treated with 38
      all-ceramic (AC) and 37 metal-ceramic (MC) implant-supported single-tooth
      restorations. A quasi-randomisation of consecutively included restorations in
      patients with one or more implants was used, i.e. a combination of parallel group
      (for 13 patients with one restoration) and split-mouth (for 23 patients with >/=2
      restorations). All patients were recalled for baseline and 1-year followup
      examinations. Biological and technical outcomes, including complications, were
      clinically and radiographically registered. The Copenhagen Index Score and visual
      analogue scale (VAS) score were used to assess professional and patient-reported 
      aesthetic outcomes, respectively, by blinded assessors. RESULTS: One-year after
      loading, no patient dropped out and no implant failed, though one MC restoration 
      had to be remade. The marginal bone loss was not significantly different between 
      AC and MC restorations (AC: mean 0.08 mm, SD 0.25; MC: mean 0.10 mm, SD 0.17).
      Seven out of 10 inflammatory reactions were registered at AC restorations. Two
      technical complications, one loss of retention and one chipping of veneering
      porcelain were recorded at two metal-ceramic crowns. The marginal adaptation of
      the all-ceramic crowns was significantly less optimal than the metal-ceramic
      crowns (P = 0.014). The professional-reported colour match of all-ceramic crowns 
      was significantly better than metal-ceramic crowns (P = 0.031), but other
      aesthetic parameters as well as the VAS scores demonstrated no statistically
      significant difference between AC and MC restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Marginal bone
      loss and the aesthetic outcomes were not significantly different between AC and
      MC restorations in this short-term follow-up study, though inflammatory reactions
      in the peri-implant mucosa as well as less optimal marginal adaptation were more 
      frequently registered for all-ceramic compared to the metal-ceramic crowns.

TI  - Retrospective 2- to 7-Year Follow-Up Study of 20 Double Full-Arch
      Implant-Supported Monolithic Zirconia Fixed Prostheses: Measurements and
      Recommendations for Optimal Design.
PG  - 501-508
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12528 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To measure the extension of cantilever lengths, thicknesses, and heights
      of zirconia prostheses in the lingual and facial areas of the distal screw access
      openings, and to evaluate the clinical performance regarding chipping or fracture
      of the distal cantilevered sections of double full-arch CAD/CAM screw-retained,
      stained, monolithic zirconia, gingival-colored ceramic implant-supported fixed
      prostheses (MZ-FPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten edentulous patients were provided
      with a total of 20 CAD/CAM double full-arch MZ-FPs. The zirconia thicknesses
      around distal screw access openings at three different levels (crown height
      space, screw access opening lengths, and dimensions of the cantilevered segments)
      were measured in the resin prototypes. Patients were evaluated clinically
      (visually) without magnification, with intraoral digital photography, and
      radiologically by the author, approximately every 6 months. Ten patients with 20 
      MZ-FPs were evaluated. Twenty resin prototypes with 35 cantilevered segments (15 
      maxillary, 20 mandibular) were measured. The lingual and facial thicknesses of
      the resin frameworks and the crown height spaces of 35 distal access openings
      were measured. RESULTS: The average extension of the maxillary cantilever
      segments was 7.72 mm; the mandibular cantilever average was 13.72 mm. The average
      crown height space for maxillary prostheses was 13.27 mm, for the mandibular
      prostheses it was 11.89 mm. Zirconia thickness around distal screw access
      openings at the middle of the crowns, margins and middle of the gingival areas
      (buccal side of maxillary prostheses) was 4.29, 3.79, and 3.87 mm, respectively. 
      On the lingual sides the thicknesses were 3.13, 2.85, and 3.15 mm, respectively. 
      For mandibular prostheses the thicknesses were 3.56, 3.08, and 3.15 mm,
      respectively, on the buccal sides, and 2.07, 2.00, and 2.99 mm, respectively, on 
      the lingual sides. No implant failure or changes in the occlusal surface,
      chipping of the cuspid or incisal edges, or prosthesis distal extension fractures
      were observed during follow-up periods ranging from 2 to 7 years. The survival
      rate was 100% for implants and prostheses. In one of the patients, chipping of
      the pink ceramic was noted in the maxillary prosthesis 36 months after placement.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that full-arch MZ-FPs without
      cutback, or with partial digital cutback and veneering ceramic, were a
      therapeutic option. Recommendations regarding the thickness of zirconia at the
      level of the distal screw access openings, the crown height spaces, and the
      lengths of the cantilever segments were recorded. Additional in vitro and
      clinical studies will be required for more scientific analysis of the criteria
      for design of this type of prosthesis to minimize prosthetic complications.
      Long-term and multicenter studies are needed to corroborate the findings
      discussed in this report.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term clinical outcome of inlay-retained fixed
      dental prostheses (IRFDPs) made from lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: Forty-five IRFDPs were placed in 42 patients (21 women, mean age
      36.1 years and 21 men, mean age 42.0 years). The IRFDPs replaced 4 premolars and 
      19 first molars in the maxilla and 4 premolars and 18 first molars in the
      mandible. All teeth were prepared following a standardized protocol for ceramic
      inlay restorations. Five of the 45 FDPs were hybrid-retained restorations, i.e.
      one abutment tooth with an inlay retainer and one with a full crown retainer. All
      restorations were fabricated from heat-pressed lithium-disilicate ceramic (IPS
      e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent AG). The minimal size of the proximal connector was
      16 mm(2) (4 mm x 4 mm in height and width) with a minimum occlusal ceramic
      thickness of 1.5 mm. Hydrofluoric acid etching (5%) and silane application was
      used for conditioning the bonding surfaces. Standard adhesive luting techniques
      were performed using a dentin adhesive and a resin composite. Standardized
      follow-up reports were performed annually. The survival rates were performed
      using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 100
      months (minimum 4, maximum 234 months). Thirty-three FDPs (73%) failed during the
      observation period and had to be replaced by other restorations. The Kaplan-Meier
      survival rate for IRFDPs was 57% after 5 years, 38% after 8 years and 22% after
      15 years, while for hybrid-retained FDPs it was 100% after 5 years, 60% after 8
      years and also 60% after 15 years. CONCLUSION: With the design used in the
      current, study lithium-disilicate ceramic IRFDP had a high clinical failure rate 
      and cannot be recommended for regular clinical use.

TI  - The longevity of direct and indirect posterior restorations is uncertain and may 
      be affected by a number of dentist-, patient-, and material-related factors.
PG  - 30-1

AB  - SELECTION CRITERIA: Information pertaining to how the studies were located and
      selected was very limited. The authors did state that they reviewed the ""dental
      literature predominately from 1990"" that reported on clinical studies with a
      minimum 2-year follow-up and at least an N of 10 at-risk restorations at the last
      recall. KEY STUDY FACTOR: Although a number of important study factors were
      identified that could potentially impact posterior restoration survival, such as 
      secondary caries, incorrect manipulation of the materials, or material fracture, 
      no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria were identified that were applied
      across all studies reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: This review concentrated on
      the longevity of restorations on posterior teeth subject to occlusal forces. The 
      main outcome measure was survival of the restoration. Where applicable, measures 
      of cause (secondary caries, marginal adaptation, fracture, wear, and so forth)
      were reported. MAIN RESULTS: There were 42 amalgam studies, 51 direct composite, 
      5 direct composite with inserts, 7 compomer, 6 glass ionomer, 7 GI tunnel
      restorations, 6 GI ART restorations, 20 composite inlays and onlays, 36
      laboratory-fabricated ceramic inlays and onlays, 20 CAD-CAM ceramic inlays and
      onlays, and 19 cast gold inlays and onlays. The values reported for annual
      failure rate were calculated for mean, median, and standard deviation for each
      material. Mean (SD) annual failure rates for posterior stress-bearing cavities
      were as follows: 3.0% (1.9%) for amalgam restorations, 2.2% (2.0%) for direct
      composites, 3.6% (4.2%) for direct composites with inserts, 1.1% (1.2%) for
      compomer restorations, 7.2% (5.6%) for regular glass ionomer restorations, 7.1%
      (2.8%) for tunnel glass ionomers, 6.0% (4.6%) for ART glass ionomers, 2.9% (2.6%)
      for composite inlays, 1.9% (1.8%) for ceramic restorations, 1.7% (1.6%) for
      CAD/CAM ceramic restorations, and 1.4%(1.4%) for cast gold inlays and onlays.
      CONCLUSIONS: ""Longevity of dental restorations is dependent upon many different
      factors, including materials-, patient- and dentist-related factors."" ""Principal 
      reasons for failure were secondary caries, fracture, marginal deficiencies, wear,
      and postoperative sensitivity. We need to learn to distinguish between reasons
      that cause early failures and those that are responsible for restoration loss
      after several years of service.""

AB  - Stainless steel crowns are the most popular restoration technique for young
      permanent first molars treated endodontically. However, these restorations are
      not aesthetically appealing and need to be replaced. Endocrowns constitute a
      reliable approach for restoring severely damaged molars and premolars. Intraoral 
      scanners (IOSs) are well tolerated by children and are easily and quickly
      implemented. We present an innovative treatment approach for endodontically
      treated teeth in children, using a digital workflow with IOS and computer-aided
      design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) fabrication of the restoration. 
      The protocol involves a thorough diagnostic phase and comprehensive treatment
      planning. Among the factors to be considered are the child's behavior, the
      parents' cooperation and compliance, and initial preparation including inhalation
      sedation, effective local anaesthesia and the use of a rubber dam. Full attention
      should be given to 1-2 mm of ferruling by the endocrown, which should be
      appropriately prepared to accommodate endocrowns for molars. IOSs include
      scanning of the prepared tooth and its antagonist, and scanning of the bite.
      CAD-CAM preparation of the restoration is followed by restoration bonding and
      follow up. Digital workflow should be considered in the treatment of
      endodontically treated molars since the high accuracy of the scanning enables
      definitive restoration in young patients.

TI  - Esthetic Restoration of Severely Discolored and Periodontically Compromised Teeth
      With Novel Digital Workflow.
PG  - 164-168; quiz 169
AB  - The objective of this article is to describe to clinicians and dental technicians
      a novel approach regarding a digital workflow that combines the use of different 
      CAD/CAM software programs to successfully address the challenge of achieving
      esthetic success in difficult cases. The ""ReShape"" concept for morphological and 
      esthetic enhancement of monolithic ceramic restorations presents a unique digital
      workflow that facilitates production of restorations with natural morphology and 
      surface texture, less need for post-milling characterizations, and excellent
      esthetic results. This approach is aimed at improving the quality of monolithic
      ceramic restorations fabricated via CAD/CAM technology by combining the
      acquisition software of an intraoral scanner with a design software.

TI  - Survival rates of IPS empress 2 all-ceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures:
      results of a 5-year prospective clinical study.
PG  - 253-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the
      survival rates of IPS Empress 2 (Ivoclar Vivadent) all-ceramic crowns and fixed
      partial dentures (FPDs) after an observation period of up to 5 years. METHOD AND 
      MATERIALS: Forty-three patients (19 women and 24 men) were included in this
      study. The patients were treated with a total of 58 adhesive bonded IPS Empress 2
      restorations. A total of 27 single crowns were placed on molars and premolars,
      and 31 three-unit FPDs were placed in the anterior and premolar regions. Clinical
      follow-up examinations took place at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after
      insertion. Statistical analysis of the data was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
      method. RESULTS: Results of the 50-month analysis (interquartile range, 33 to 61 
      months) showed that the survival rate was 100% for crowns and 70% for FPDs. Six
      failures that occurred exclusively in the three-unit FPDs were observed.
      Framework fractures were recorded in three FPD units where the connector
      dimensions did not meet the manufacturer specifications. Only one FPD exhibited
      an irreparable partial veneer fracture, and 2 FPDs showed evidence of biologic
      failures. The accuracy of fit and esthetic parameters were clinically
      satisfactory for crowns and FPDs. CONCLUSION: The results of this 5-year clinical
      evaluation suggest that IPS Empress 2 ceramic is an appropriate material for the 
      fabrication of single crowns. Because of the reduced survival rates, strict
      conditions should be considered before the use of IPS Empress 2 material for the 
      fabrication of three-unit FPDs.

TI  - Fracture resistance of crowns cemented on titanium and zirconia implant
      abutments: a comparison of monolithic versus manually veneered all-ceramic
      systems.
PG  - 1448-55
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the fracture resistance of all-ceramic crowns cemented on
      titanium and zirconia implant abutments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Customized implant
      abutments for maxillary right central incisors made of titanium (Ti) and zirconia
      (Zr) (n=60, n=30 per group) were fabricated for an internal connection implant
      system. All-ceramic crowns were fabricated for their corresponding implant
      abutments using the following systems (n=10 per group): (1) monolithic
      computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) lithium disilicate 
      (MLD); (2) pressed lithium disilicate (PLD); (3) yttrium stabilized tetragonal
      zirconia polycrystal (YTZP). The frameworks of both PLD and YTZP systems were
      manually veneered with a fluorapatite-based ceramic. The crowns were adhesively
      cemented to their implant abutments and loaded to fracture in a universal testing
      machine (0.5 mm/minute). Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance
      (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Both the abutment material
      (P=.0001) and the ceramic crown system (P=.028) significantly affected the
      results. Interaction terms were not significant (P=.598). Ti-MLD (558.5+/-35 N)
      showed the highest mean fracture resistance among all abutment-crown combinations
      (340.3+/-62-495.9+/-53 N) (P<.05). Both MLD and veneered ceramic systems in
      combination with Ti abutments (558.5+/-35-495.9+/-53 N) presented significantly
      higher values than with Zr abutments (392.9+/-55-340.3+/-62 N) (P<.05). MLD crown
      system showed significantly higher mean fracture resistance compared to manually 
      veneered ones on both Ti and Zr abutments (P<.05). While Ti-MLD and Ti-PLD
      abutment-crown combinations failed only in the crowns without abutment fractures,
      Zr-YTZP combination failed exclusively in the abutment without crown fracture.
      Zr-MLD and Zr-PLD failed predominantly in both the abutment and the crown.
      Ti-YTZP showed only implant neck distortion. CONCLUSIONS: The highest fracture
      resistance was obtained with titanium abutments restored with MLD crowns, but the
      failure type was more favorable with Ti-YTZP combination.

AB  - DATA SOURCES: Medline and manual searches were made of the bibliographies of all 
      full-text articles and related reviews selected from the electronic search and
      the following journals: American Journal of Dentistry, Australian Dental Journal,
      British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Clinical Implant Dentistry and
      Related Research, Clinical Oral Implants Research, Deutsche Zahnarztliche
      Zeitschrift, European Journal of Oral Sciences, International Dental Journal,
      International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants, International Journal

      Journal of Dental Research, Journal of Oral Implantology, Journal of Oral
      Rehabilitation, Journal of Periodontology, Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry,
      Quintessence International, Swedish Dental Journal and Schweizerische
      Monatsschrift Zahnmedizin. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective or retrospective cohort
      studies were included if they had a mean follow-up of 5 years or more; were
      reported in the dental literature in the English or German language; patients had
      been examined clinically at the follow-up visit; and details of the
      characteristics of the suprastructures were reported. Publications that combined 
      findings for both implant-supported fixed partial dentures and single-tooth
      crowns were selected if they allowed for extraction of the data for the
      single-tooth crowns group. Publications based on patient records only or on
      questionnaires or interviews were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:
      Failure and complication rates are calculated by dividing the number of events
      (failures or complications; the numerator) by the total exposure time [single
      crown (SC) time and/ or implant time; the denominator]. Event rates for SC and/
      or implants were calculated by dividing the total number of events by the total
      SC or implant exposure time in years. The total number of events was considered
      to be Poisson distributed. To assess heterogeneity of the study-specific event
      rates, the Spearman goodness-of fit statistics and associated probability value
      were calculated. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to investigate
      formally whether event rates varied by crown material (metal-ceramic vs
      all-ceramic) or crown design (cemented vs screw-retained). RESULTS: Twenty-six
      studies were included in the meta-analysis. Survival of implants supporting SC
      was 96.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 95.9-97.6%] after 5 years. The survival 
      rate of SC supported by implants was 94.5% (95% CI, 92.5-95.9%) after 5 years of 
      function. The survival rate of metal-ceramic crowns, 95.4% (95% CI, 93.6-96.7%), 
      was significantly higher (P 0.005) than the survival rate (91.2%; 95% CI,
      86.8-94.2%), of all-ceramic crowns. Peri-implantitis and soft tissue
      complications occurred adjacent to 9.7% of the SC and 6.3% of the implants had
      bone loss exceeding 2 mm over the 5-year observation period. The cumulative
      incidence of implant fractures after 5 years was 0.14%. After 5 years, the
      cumulative incidence of screw or abutment loosening was 12.7%, and was 0.35% for 
      screw or abutment fracture. For suprastructure-related complications, the
      cumulative incidence of ceramic or veneer fractures was 4.5%. CONCLUSIONS: An
      observation period of 5 years allows the conclusion that high survival rates of
      implants and implant-supported SC can be expected, but biological and,
      particularly, technical complications are frequent.

TI  - The clinical success of zirconia-based crowns: a systematic review.
PG  - 33-43
LID - 10.11607/ijp.3647 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This review aimed to evaluate the documented clinical success of
      zirconia based crowns in clinical trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic
      databases were searched for original studies reporting on the clinical
      performance of tooth- or implant-supported zirconia-based crowns, including
      PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct. The electronic search was
      complemented by manual searches of the bibliographies of all retrieved full-text 
      articles and reviews as well as a hand search of the following journals:
      International Journal of Prosthodontics, Journal of Oral Rehabilitation,
      International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Implants, and Clinical Oral
      Implants Research. RESULTS: The search yielded 3,216 titles. Based on
      preestablished criteria, 42 full-text articles were obtained. While 16 studies
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria, only 3 randomized controlled trials were
      reported. Seven studies reported on tooth-supported and 4 on implant-supported
      crowns, and 5 studies reported on both types of support. Ten studies on
      tooth-supported and 7 on implant supported crowns provided sufficient material
      for statistical analysis. Life table analysis revealed cumulative 5-year survival
      rates of 95.9% for tooth-supported and 97.1% for implant-supported crowns. For
      implant-supported crowns, the most common reasons for failure were technical
      (veneering material fractures). For tooth-supported crowns, technical (veneering 
      material fractures, loss of retention) and biologic (endodontic/ periodontic)
      reasons for failure were equally common. The most common complications for
      implant-supported crowns were veneering material fractures and bleeding on
      probing. For tooth-supported crowns, the most common complications were loss of
      retention, endodontic treatment, veneering material fractures, and bleeding on
      probing. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the success rate of tooth-supported
      and implant-supported zirconia-based crowns is adequate, similar, and comparable 
      to that of conventional porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns. These results are,
      however, based on a relatively small number of studies, many that are not
      controlled clinical trials. Well-designed studies with large patient groups and
      long follow-up times are needed before general recommendations for the use of
      zirconia-based restorations can be provided.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the shock absorbing
      capacity of implant-supported restorations (CAD/CAM composite resin or zirconia
      abutment with composite resin or porcelain crown/onlay) and a simulated natural
      tooth complex using the Periometer((R)) . MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and
      twenty Morse taper implants (Titamax CM 11 mm) were mounted on bone-simulating
      acrylic resin base and restored with CAD/CAM zirconia (60) and metal composite
      resin Paradigm MZ100 (60) abutments. Using CEREC3, standardized onlays (60) and
      crowns (60) were designed and milled in ceramic (Paradigm C) or composite resin
      (Paradigm MZ100) to simulate a maxillary premolar. All restorations were luted
      with a preheated light curing composite resin (Filtek Z100). Fifteen extracted
      human upper premolars were mounted with a simulated PDL and used as control
      group. The Periometer((R)) , a new handheld percussion probe that measures the
      energy loss coefficient (LC) for both natural teeth and implant-supported
      structures, was positioned perpendicularly to the buccal surface of each
      restoration. Three measurements of the LC were collected for each specimen. The
      effect of each variable (abutment material, restoration material, and restoration
      design) on the LC was explored using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS:
      Differences in LC between the abutment material (zirconia/Paradigm MZ100), the
      restoration material (Paradigm C/Paradigm MZ100) and the restoration design
      (onlay/crown) were recorded. The average LC of zirconia and metal composite resin
      abutments ranged from 0.040 to 0.053 and 0.059 to 0.068, respectively. Zirconia
      abutments restored with composite resin restorations (LC 0.051-0.053) had the
      closest LC value when compared with teeth with simulated PDL (0.049). CONCLUSION:
      Composite resin onlays/crowns bonded to zirconia implant abutments presented
      similar dynamic response to load (damping behavior) when compared to teeth with a
      simulated PDL.

AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study was designed to evaluate and compare the marginal
      gap, internal fit, and fracture load of resin-bonded, leucite-reinforced glass
      ceramic mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) inlays fabricated by computer-aided
      design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) or hot pressing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty
      caries-free extracted human molars were prepared for standardized MOD inlays.
      Impressions of each specimen were made and poured using type IV dental stone.
      Dies were randomly divided into two equal groups. Twenty-five ceramic inlays were
      fabricated by the hot-pressed technique using IPS Empress leucite-reinforced
      glass ceramics, and the other 25 ceramic inlays were produced by CAD/CAM
      technology using ProCAD leucite-reinforced ceramic blocks and CEREC inLab
      facilities. Inlays were bonded to the teeth using a dual-cured resin cement. The 
      specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours and then
      thermocycled for 5000 cycles. The marginal gap measurements were taken with a
      stereomicroscope. Specimens in each group of inlay systems were randomly divided 
      into two subgroups of 10 and 15 specimens each. Ten specimens in each subgroup
      were sectioned mesiodistally for evaluation of the internal fit. The fracture
      load of specimens in the second subgroup (n = 15) of the two inlay systems was
      determined under compressive load in a universal testing machine. Data were
      analyzed using Student's t-test at a significance level of p < 0.05. RESULTS: The
      mean marginal and internal gap size in both IPS Empress and ProCAD inlays were
      less than 100 mum; however, the marginal gap for the IPS Empress restorations was
      significantly higher than that of ProCAD restorations (p < 0.05). There was no
      significant difference in the mean internal fit or the fracture load between the 
      two glass ceramic inlays (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The leucite-reinforced glass
      ceramic inlay restorations fabricated by CEREC inLab (CAD/CAM) and the
      hot-pressed technique provided clinically acceptable marginal and internal fit
      with comparable fracture loads after luting.

TI  - A systematic review of the survival and complication rates of fixed partial
      dentures (FPDs) after an observation period of at least 5 years.
PG  - 667-76
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the survival of
      cantilever fixed partial dentures (FPDs) and the incidence of biological and
      technical complications. METHODS: An electronic MEDLINE search supplemented by
      manual searching was conducted to identify prospective and retrospective cohort
      studies on FPDs with a mean follow-up time of at least 5 years. Patients had to
      have been examined clinically at the follow-up visit. Assessment of the
      identified studies and data abstraction was performed independently by two
      reviewers. Failure and complication rates were analyzed using random-effects
      Poisson regression to obtain summary estimates of 10-year survival proportions.
      RESULTS: From a yield of 3658 titles and 211 abstracts, 81 articles were selected
      for full-text analysis, finally resulting in 13 studies that met the inclusion
      criteria. Meta-analysis of these studies resulted in an estimated survival rate
      of cantilever FPDs of 81.8% (95 percent confidence interval (95% CI): 78.2-84.9%)
      and success rate (free of all complications) of 63% (95% CI: 54.7-70.2%) after 10
      years. The most common biological complication was loss of pulp vitality (32.6%) 
      followed by caries at abutment teeth (9.1%). After a 10-year observation period
      2.6% of the FPDs were lost as a result of dental caries and 1% due to recurrent
      periodontitis. The most frequent technical complication was loss of retention
      (16.1%) followed by material fractures (5.9%). The cumulative incidence of
      fractures of abutment teeth was 2.9% and 2.4% of the FPDs were lost as a result
      of abutment tooth fracture after an observation period of 10 years. CONCLUSION:
      This systematic review on cantilever fixed partial dentures indicated that
      survival and success rates of cantilever fixed partial dentures were lower than
      those of conventional end-abutment supported FPDs described in a review by Tan et
      al. (2004) and biological and technical complications were frequent.

TI  - Esthetic Restoration of Severely Discolored and Periodontically Compromised Teeth
      With Novel Digital Workflow.
PG  - e1-e4
AB  - The implementation of digital technologies for interdisciplinary treatment
      planning and fabrication of monolithic ceramic restorations is a standard
      protocol in modern dentistry. Teeth with severe discoloration, soft-tissue
      defects, and multiple diastemas are common challenges clinicians face when
      performing restorative dentistry. The objective of this article is to describe to
      clinicians and dental technicians a novel approach regarding a digital workflow
      that combines the use of different CAD/CAM software programs to successfully
      address the challenge of achieving esthetic success in difficult cases. The
      ""ReShape"" concept for morphological and esthetic enhancement of monolithic
      ceramic restorations presents a unique digital workflow that facilitates
      production of restorations with natural morphology and surface texture, less need
      for post-milling characterizations, and excellent esthetic results. This approach
      is aimed at improving the quality of monolithic ceramic restorations fabricated
      via CAD/CAM technology by combining the acquisition software of an intraoral
      scanner with a design software.

TI  - Clinical long-term results of VITA In-Ceram Classic crowns and fixed partial
      dentures: A systematic literature review.
PG  - 355-63
AB  - PURPOSE: VITA In-Ceram Classic is a system designed to fabricate all-ceramic
      crowns and fixed partial dentures (FPDs) with a glass-infiltrated aluminum oxide 
      core material. This systematic literature review gives an overview of the
      clinical performance of the VITA In-Ceram Classic Alumina, Spinell, and Zirconia 
      restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a systematic literature review, an 
      evidence-based selection and assessment of clinical studies of VITA In-Ceram
      Classic ceramics was carried out. RESULTS: A total of 299 publications were
      found, 21 of which met the inclusion criteria. Only a few meaningful studies of
      In-Ceram Alumina FPDs and In-Ceram Zirconia crowns and FPDs were found. The
      5-year survival rate of In-Ceram Alumina crowns and In-Ceram Spinell crowns
      ranged from 91.7% to 100% and is similar to the survival rate of conventional
      metal-ceramic crowns. The 5-year survival rate of single-retainer In-Ceram
      Alumina resin-bonded FPDs (RBFPDs) was 92.3%, which is higher than that of
      2-retainer RBFPDs. CONCLUSION: In-Ceram Classic Alumina can be recommended for
      anterior and posterior crowns as well as for anterior single-retainer RBFPDs.
      Further studies should be initiated to evaluate in detail the clinical
      performance of In-Ceram Classic Alumina FPDs. In-Ceram Classic Spinell can be
      recommended for anterior crowns, especially if highly esthetic results are
      requested. For In-Ceram Classic Zirconia crowns or FPDs no statement can be made 
      presently because of insufficient data.

TI  - The use of PEEK in digital prosthodontics: A narrative review.
PG  - 217
LID - 10.1186/s12903-020-01202-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD-CAM) technology led to the introduction of an increasing number of
      machinable materials suitable for dental prostheses. One of these materials is
      polyetheretherketone (PEEK), a high performance polymer recently used in
      dentistry with favorable physical, mechanical and chemical properties. The
      purpose of this study was to review the current published literature on the use
      of PEEK for the fabrication of dental prostheses with CAD-CAM techniques.
      METHODS: Electronic database searches were performed using the terms ""PEEK"",
      ""CAD-CAM"", ""dental"", ""dentistry"" to identify studies related to the use of PEEK
      for the fabrication of CAD-CAM prostheses. The search period spanned from January
      1990 through February 2020. Both in vivo and in vitro studies in English were
      eligible. Review articles and the references of the included publications were
      searched to identify relevant articles. RESULTS: A great number of in vitro
      studies are available in the current literature pointing out the noticeable
      properties of PEEK. The use of PEEK has been recommended for a wide range of
      CAD-CAM fabricated fixed and removable dental prostheses. PEEK was additionally
      recommended for occlusal splints, intra-radicular posts, implant abutments,
      customized healing abutments and provisional restorations. However, only a few
      clinical studies were identified. CONCLUSIONS: PEEK could be considered as a
      viable alternative for CAD-CAM fixed and removable dental prostheses to
      well-established dental materials. Due to the scarcity of clinical data, clinical
      trials are needed to assess the long-term performance of PEEK prostheses.

      fabricated using hybrid polymer and ceramic CAD/CAM materials regarding their
      biologic, technical and esthetical outcomes. PICOS search strategy was applied
      using MEDLINE and were searched for RCTs and case control studies by two
      reviewers using MeSH Terms. Bias risk was evaluated using the Cochrane
      collaboration tool and Newcastle-Ottawa assessment scale. A meta-analysis was
      conducted to calculate the mean long-term survival difference of both materials
      at two different periods (</=24, >/=36 months(m)). Mean differences in biologic, 
      technical and esthetical complications of partial vs. full crown reconstructions 
      were analyzed using software package R (p < 0.05). 28 studies included in the
      systematic review and 25 studies in the meta-analysis. The overall survival rate 
      was 99% (0.95-1.00, </=24 m) and dropped to 95% (0.87-0.98, >/=36 m), while the
      overall success ratio was 88% (0.54-0.98; </=24 m) vs. 77% (0.62-0.88; >/=36 m). 
      No significance, neither for the follow-up time points, nor for biologic,
      technical and esthetical (88% vs. 77%; 90% vs. 74%; 96% vs. 95%) outcomes was
      overserved. A significance was found for the technical/clinical performance
      between full 93% (0.88-0.96) and partial 64% (0.34-0.86) crowns. The biologic
      success rate of partial crowns with 69% (0.42-0.87) was lower, but not
      significant compared to 91% (0.79-0.97) of full crowns. The esthetical success
      rate of partial crowns with 90% (0.65-0.98) was lower, but not significant
      compared to 99% (0.92-1.00) of full crowns.

TI  - Clinical Evaluation of Three Types of CAD/CAM Inlay/ Onlay Materials After 1-Year
      Clinical Follow Up.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical performance and the marginal adaptation of
      inlay/ onlay restorations made of lithium of a new lithium disilicate
      strengthened, lithium alumino-silicate glass-ceramic (LAS) material compared with
      a conventional lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (LDS) and new-generation
      polymer-based CAD/CAM resin composite (CS) materials over one year. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Seventy-five inlay-onlay restorations were placed in 35 patients. The
      restorations were assigned and randomized to three groups as LDS, LAS, and CS.
      Clinical evaluations were performed after one week, six months, and one year
      after the cementation, according to the modified United States Public Health
      Services (USPHS) criteria. The marginal quality analyses of 21 samples (n=7) were
      assessed under a scanning electron microscope. The data were analyzed by using
      Friedman, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks, Chi-square and Paired t-tests (p0.05). RESULTS: 
      No statistically significant difference (p0.05) was found between groups in the
      modified USPHS, gingival index, and plaque index evaluations, and the total
      success rate was 100% for three groups after one year. Following SEM evaluations 
      in all groups, continuous margin percentages were decreased, but these results
      were not statistically significant (p0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lithium
      disilicate-strengthened lithium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics can be considered 
      a reliable material for an option for posterior onlay/inlay restorations.

TI  - Comparison of endocrowns made of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic or
      polymer-infiltrated ceramic networks and direct composite resin restorations:
      fatigue performance and stress distribution.

LID - S1751-6161(19)30995-6 [pii]

AB  - This study compared the fatigue performance and the stress distribution of
      endodontically treated molars restored with endocrowns obtained with lithium
      disilicate glass-ceramic or a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network, both processed
      by CAD-CAM, and direct composite restorations. Forty-eight human mandibular
      molars were randomly assigned into 03 groups (n=16) and restored with endocrowns 
      (LD - lithium disilicate glass-ceramic or PICN - polymer-infiltrated ceramic
      network) or with direct composite restorations. Fatigue testing followed a
      step-stress approach (initial maximum load of 200N and 5000 cycles, incremental
      step load of 200N and 10,000 cycles/step, being the specimens loaded until
      failure or to a maximum of 135,000 cycles at 2800N). The fatigue failure load and
      number of cycles until failure were recorded and statistically analyzed.
      Fractographic and finite element (FEA) analyzes were conducted as well. There
      were no differences in fatigue failure load, number of cycles until fracture and 
      mean survival probabilities among groups. However, indirect endocrowns had higher
      mechanical structural reliability, and LD restorations lasted more time before
      start to failing. FEA showed that the stress concentration in tooth tissues was
      higher for the resin composite, followed by PICN and LD in a decreasing order.
      Almost all fractures were restricted to the restorative material (without tooth
      involvement), and origins were identified at occlusal surface. The type of
      restoration did not influence the fatigue failure load, number of cycles until
      fracture and mean survival probabilities of the restorative strategies. Despite
      that, the mechanical structural reliability of endocrowns, especially those made 
      of lithium disilicate, was higher and lasted more time before start to failing.

LID - 10.11607/ijp.2768 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the 4-year clinical performance of IPS Empress II
      ceramic onlay restorations on extensively restored, endodontically treated
      molars. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 53 morphologically compromised and
      endodontically treated molar teeth were restored with IPS Empress II ceramic
      onlays cemented with a dual cured luting composite. The molars were evaluated by 
      two experienced clinicians in accordance with the modified United States Public
      Health Service criteria at baseline and 6-month recalls up to a 4-year
      observation period. The analyses were carried out using the Wilcoxon signed-rank 
      test and the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. RESULTS: Four failures were
      noted. Two onlays debonded; one was reinserted and reluted while the other
      resulted in lost coronal hard tissue and was restored with a fiber reinforced
      post-and-core system followed by a full ceramic crown restoration. The third
      failure resulted from secondary caries and fracture of the remaining enamel and
      was restored with a full ceramic crown. The fourth failure was extracted. None of
      the onlays exhibited wear, fracture of antagonist teeth, or dimensional change at
      proximal contacts. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study's design and 
      short 4-year observation period, IPS Empress II ceramic onlay restorations
      demonstrated promising results with a 92.5% success rate.

TI  - Remakes of Colorlogic and IPS Empress ceramic restorations in general practice.
PG  - 621-5
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this article was to study frequencies and distribution of
      remakes of all-ceramic inlays/onlays, veneers, and crowns occurring before and
      after cementation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,069 sintered feldspathic
      ceramic restorations (Colorlogic) and 1,136 pressure-molded ceramic restorations 
      (IPS Empress 1 and 2) were produced during the study period by one dental
      laboratory. The laboratory gave an unqualified and unlimited guarantee for their 
      ceramic restorations. The outcome variable was reports from the clinicians to the
      dental laboratory about any problems related to the restoration, necessitating
      remake. RESULTS: Problems occurring before cementation occurred in 4.4% of the
      restorations. Veneers were remade more frequently than the other types of
      restorations (6.6%). After cementation, the overall 2-year rate of remakes was
      1%, indicating a survival rate of the ceramic restorations of 99%, with
      inlays/onlays exhibiting the highest (99.8%) and crowns the lowest (98.4%) rates.
      This difference in rates was significant. No significant differences in remakes
      between ceramics or tooth categories were found. CONCLUSION: There were few
      problems in a short- to medium-term perspective that, in the opinion of general
      practitioners, necessitated remakes of all-ceramic restorations.

TI  - Survival and complication rates of fixed restorations supported by locking-taper 
      implants: a prospective study with 1 to 10 years of follow-up.
PG  - 434-44
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12152 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this 10-year follow-up study was to evaluate the implant
      survival and complication rates of fixed restorations supported by locking-taper 
      implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 10-year period (January 2002 to December 
      2011) all patients referred to a single private practice for treatment with fixed
      restorations (single crowns, SCs; fixed partial prostheses, FPPs; fixed full
      arches, FFAs) supported by dental implants were considered for inclusion in the
      study. At each annual follow-up session, clinical, radiographic, and prosthetic
      parameters were assessed. The surviving implant-supported restorations were
      defined as ""complication free"" in the absence of any biological or prosthetic
      (mechanical or technical) complication. The cumulative implant survival and the
      ""complication-free"" survival of fixed implant-supported restorations were
      identified using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Log-rank test was used to identify 
      correlations between the study variables. RESULTS: In total, 1494 locking-taper
      implants (727 maxilla, 767 mandible) were placed in 642 patients (356 males, 286 
      females). Nineteen implants (12 maxilla, 7 mandible) failed. Implant failures
      were attributed to lack of osseointegration (14 implants), peri-implantitis (4
      implants), and mechanical overloading (1 implant). An overall 10-year cumulative 
      implant survival rate of 98.7% (98.3% maxilla, 99.1% mandible) was found. The
      implant survival rates did not significantly differ with respect to implant
      location, position, bone type, implant length and diameter, and type of
      restorations. Among the surviving implant-supported restorations (478 SC, 242
      FPP, 19 FFA), a few biological (11/739: 1.4%) and prosthetic (27/739: 3.6%)
      complications were reported. The incidence of mechanical complications was low
      (3/739: 0.4%), with three loosened abutments in three SCs (3/478: 0.6%), and no
      abutment fractures; technical complications were more frequent (24/739: 3.2%),
      with an incidence of decementation of 2.0% (SC 2.0%, FPP 1.6%, FFA 5.2%) and
      ceramic/veneer chipping/fracture of 1.2% (SC 0.0%, FPP 2.8%, FFA 10.5%). A
      10-year cumulative ""complication-free"" survival of restorations of 88.6% (SC
      91.7%, FPP 83.1%, FFA 73.8%) was reported. The complication rates differ
      significantly with respect to the type of restoration (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the fracture strength of crowns
      made from current CAD/CAM materials. In addition the influence of crown thickness
      and chewing simulation on the fracture strength was evaluated. METHODS: Crowns
      were fabricated from lithium disilicate, zirconia reinforced lithium silicate
      (ZLS-ceramic) and a polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) with an occlusal
      thickness of 1.0mm or 1.5mm, respectively (n=16). Crowns were cemented on
      composite dies. Subgroups of eight specimens were loaded with 5kg in a chewing
      simulator for 1,200,000 cycles with thermal cycling. Finally, all specimens were 
      loaded until fracture in a universal testing machine. Three-way ANOVA was used to
      detect statistical interaction. Differences regarding the materials were tested
      with two-way ANOVA, following one-way ANOVA and a post-hoc Tukey's-Test. RESULTS:
      All crowns survived the chewing simulation. The material had a significant
      influence on the fracture resistance (p</=0.05). Lithium disilicate achieved the 
      highest values of fracture strength in almost all groups followed by ZLS-ceramic.
      PICN achieved the lowest values of fracture strength. Chewing simulation
      increased the fracture strength of thick lithium disilicate crown significantly. 
      Greater occlusal thickness of all crown materials resulted in higher crown
      fracture strength before chewing simulation. After chewing simulation occlusal
      thickness of lithium disilicate and PICN crowns had no significant influence on
      the fracture strength. CONCLUSIONS: All crowns revealed fracture strength above
      the clinically expected loading forces. Therefore the durability of the tested
      CAD/CAM materials seems promising also in an occlusal thickness of 1.0mm.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the load bearing capacity and a
      reasonable thicknesss of dental monolithic zirconia crowns. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) abutment tooth specimens were made by
      CAD/CAM technic. Monolithic zirconia crowns (MZC), monolithic lithium disilicate 
      crowns (MLC), layered zirconia crowns (LZC) and metal ceramic crowns(MCC), of
      which the occlusal thickness was 1.5mm were thereafter fabricated and cemented on
      the abutment tooth specimens. MCC with occlusal thicknesses of 0.6mm, 0.8mm,
      1.00mm, 1.2mm were also made. All specimens underwent load-to-fracture test.
      Weibull parameters (sigma0) and (m) were calculated. Fracture modes were also
      evaluated. RESULTS: The mean fracture load was 1863.16+/-116.81 for MLC,
      2284.77+/-355.60 for MCC, 2308.0+/-510.94 for LZC, 4109.93+/-610.18 for MZC
      (1.5mm), 3068.31+/-233.88 for MZC (1.2mm), 2429.88+/-315.03 for MZC (1.0mm),
      1814.60+/-68.21 for MZC (0.8mm) and 1308.38+/-111.38 for MZC (0.6mm). The
      fracture load of MZC was significantly higher than MCC, LZC and MLC (P<0.05). The
      fracture loads for MCC with different thickness were significantly different
      (P<0.05). Similar trend was observed for the characteristic strength (sigma0) and
      Weibull modulus (m). For MZC and MLC, the fracture mode was catastrophic failure.
      The predominant fracture mode for LZC was catastrophic fracture. The fracture
      loads of MZC(1.0mm) and MCC were not statistically different (P>0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Monolithic zirconia crowns exhibit higher fracture loads than
      monolithic lithium disilicate crowns, layered zirconia crowns and metal ceramic
      crowns. The fracture resistance of monolithic zirconia crowns with a thickness of
      1.0mm can be equal to metal ceramic crowns. Doubling the monolithic zirconia core
      from 0.6mm to 1.5mm increases the fracture resistance of this restorative system 
      threefold.

      restorations.
PG  - 70-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this clinical retrospective study was to evaluate the
      clinical quality, estimated survival rate, and failure analysis of different
      all-ceramic restorations in a long-term analysis of up to 20 years. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Different all-ceramic restorations (crowns [n = 470], veneers [n = 318],
      onlays [n = 213], and inlays ]n = 334[) were placed in 302 patients (120 men, 182
      women) between 1987 and 2009 at Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.
      Clinical examination was performed during patients' regularly scheduled
      maintenance appointments. Esthetic match, porcelain surface, marginal
      discoloration, and integrity were evaluated following modified California Dental 
      Association/Ryge criteria. Number of restoration failures and reasons for failure
      were recorded. The study population included 106 (35.1%) individuals diagnosed
      with bruxism. The success rate was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival
      analysis. RESULTS: The mean observation time was 102 +/- 60 months. Ninety-five
      failures were recorded. The main reason for failure was fracture of the ceramic
      (33.68%). The estimated survival rate was 97.3% after 5 years, 93.5% at 10 years,
      and 78.5% at 20 years. Nonvital teeth showed a significantly higher risk of
      failure (P < .0001). There was a 2.3-times greater risk of failure associated
      with existing parafunction (bruxism, P = .0045). Cementation using Variolink
      showed significantly fewer failures than Optec Cement (P = .0217) and Dual Cement
      (P = .0099). No significant differences were found for type of restoration and
      distribution in the mouth. CONCLUSION: All-ceramic restorations offer a
      predictable and successful restoration with an estimated survival probability of 
      93.5% over 10 years. Significantly increased failure rates are associated with
      bruxism, nonvital teeth, and specific cementation agents.

      Systematic Review.

AB  - Owing to an increased demand for safe and esthetically pleasing dental materials,
      ceramics have been developed and optimized to rehabilitate anterior and posterior
      teeth. This evolution in ceramic materials is directly related to the development
      of sophisticated processing technologies and systems for use in dental medicine, 
      particularly computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM)
      technology. This study is a systematic review outlining long-term clinical
      survival rates of single-tooth restorations fabricated with CAD/CAM technology
      with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. A bibliographic search up to September 2016 
      was performed using two databases: MEDLINE (PubMed) and Embase. Selected keywords
      and well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria guided the search of relevant
      results. All articles were first reviewed by title, then by abstract, and
      subsequently by a full text reading. Data were assessed and extracted through a
      standardized form. The pooled results were statistically analyzed, and the
      overall failure rate was calculated by random effects model. Reported failures
      were analyzed by CAD/CAM system, type of restoration, restorative material, and
      luting agent. From a total of 2,916 single-tooth restorations with a mean
      exposure time of 7.0 years and 351 failures, the failure rate was 2.17% per year,
      estimated per 100 restoration years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35% to
      3.51%). The estimated total survival rate after 5 years was 89.7% (95% CI: 88.1% 
      to 91.1%). The overall survival rate of single-tooth ceramic restorations
      fabricated with CAD/CAM technology was similar to those conventionally
      manufactured.

TI  - Endocrowns: a clinical report.
PG  - 99-106
AB  - The endocrown is a restorative option for endodontically treated teeth. It
      consists of a circular butt-joint margin and a central retention cavity inside
      the pulp chamber and lacks intraradicular anchorage. This article describes the
      rationale and clinical guidelines for the placement of endocrowns. In the case
      presented, 2 old amalgam restorations on mandibular molars were replaced with
      endocrowns made of pressed ceramics (Empress 2, Ivoclar) following endodontic and
      periodontal therapy. A composite resin base was also used to fill undercuts and
      ensure a correct design of the preparations, contributing to significant tissue
      preservation. The postoperative situation shows the potential of this restorative
      approach to provide adequate function and esthetics, as well as biomechanical
      integrity of structurally compromised posterior nonvital teeth. It also prevents 
      interferences with periodontal tissues, thanks to a supragingival position of the
      restoration margins. The foundation of this technique is to use the surface
      available in the pulpal chamber to assume the stability and retention of the
      restoration through adhesive procedures. Guidelines for the preparation, as well 
      as the decision for omitting a post, are dictated by the amount of remaining
      coronal substance. This technique represents a promising and conservative
      alternative to full crowns for the treatment of posterior nonvital teeth that
      require long-term protection and stability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively the longevity of ceramic inlay/onlay
      restorations placed in a web-based practice-based research network and to
      investigate risk factors associated with restoration failures. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Data were collected by a practice-based research network called Ceramic 
      Success Analysis (CSA). 5791 inlay/onlay ceramic restorations were placed in 5523
      patients by 167 dentists between 1994 and 2014 in their dental practices. For
      each restoration specific information related to the tooth, procedures and
      materials used were recorded. Annual failure rates (AFRs) were calculated and
      variables associated with failure were assessed by a multivariate Cox-regression 
      analysis with shared frailty. RESULTS: The mean observation time was 3 years
      (maximum 15 years) of clinical service, and AFRs at 3 and 10 years follow up were
      calculated as 1.0% and 1.6%. Restorations with cervical outline in dentin showed 
      a 78% higher risk for failure compared to restorations with margins in enamel.
      The presence of a liner or base of glass-ionomer cement resulted in a risk for
      failure twice as large as that of restorations without liner or base material.
      Restorations performed with simplified adhesive systems (2-step etch-and-rinse
      and 1-step self-etch) presented a risk of failure 142% higher than restorations
      performed with adhesives with bonding resin as a separate step (3-step
      etch-and-rinse and 2-step self-etch). 220 failures were recorded and the most
      predominant reason for failure was fracture of the restoration or tooth (44.5%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ceramic inlay/onlay restorations made from several glass ceramic
      materials and applied by a large number of dentists showed a good survival. Deep 
      cervical cavity outline, presence of a glass ionomer lining cement, and use of
      simplified adhesive systems were risk factors for survival.

TI  - A systematic review of the performance of ceramic and metal implant abutments
      supporting fixed implant reconstructions.
PG  - 4-31

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the 5-year
      survival rates and incidences of complications associated with ceramic abutments 
      and to compare them with those of metal abutments. METHODS: An electronic Medline
      search complemented by manual searching was conducted to identify
      randomized-controlled clinical trials, and prospective and retrospective studies 
      providing information on ceramic and metal abutments with a mean follow-up time
      of at least 3 years. Patients had to have been examined clinically at the
      follow-up visit. Assessment of the identified studies and data abstraction was
      performed independently by three reviewers. Failure rates were analyzed using
      standard and random-effects Poisson regression models to obtain summary estimates
      of 5-year survival proportions. RESULTS: Twenty-nine clinical and 22 laboratory
      studies were selected from an initial yield of 7136 titles and data were
      extracted. The estimated 5-year survival rate of ceramic abutments was 99.1% [95%
      confidence interval (CI): 93.8-99.9%] and 97.4% (95% CI: 96-98.3%) for metal
      abutments. The estimated cumulative incidence of technical complications after 5 
      years was 6.9% (95% CI: 3.5-13.4%) for ceramic abutments and 15.9% (95% CI:
      11.6-21.5%) for metal abutments. Abutment screw loosening was the most frequent
      technical problem, occurring at an estimated cumulative incidence after 5 years
      of 5.1% (95% CI: 3.3-7.7%). All-ceramic crowns supported by ceramic abutments
      exhibited similar annual fracture rates as metal-ceramic crowns supported by
      metal abutments. The cumulative incidence of biological complications after 5
      years was estimated at 5.2% (95% CI: 0.4-52%) for ceramic and 7.7% (95% CI:
      4.7-12.5%) for metal abutments. Esthetic complications tended to be more frequent
      at metal abutments. A meta-analysis of the laboratory data was impossible due to 
      the non-standardized test methods of the studies included. CONCLUSION: The 5-year
      survival rates estimated from annual failure rates appeared to be similar for
      ceramic and metal abutments. The information included in this review did not
      provide evidence for differences of the technical and biological outcomes of
      ceramic and metal abutments. However, the information for ceramic abutments was
      limited in the number of studies and abutments analyzed as well as the accrued
      follow-up time. Standardized methods for the analysis of abutment strength are
      needed.

TI  - Marginal and internal adaptation of single crowns and fixed dental prostheses by 
      using digital and conventional workflows: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Digital and conventional options for definitive impressions
      and for the fabrication of fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) have been compared in
      previous studies. However, a comprehensive review with concluding data that
      determined which method provided the minimal internal and marginal adaptation is 
      lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of in
      vivo and in vitro studies was to compare the marginal and internal adaptation of 
      complete-coverage single-unit crowns and multiunit FDPs resulting from digital
      and conventional impression and fabrication methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The
      review protocol was registered in International Prospective Register of
      Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. PubMed, Cochrane Trials,
      Scopus, and Open Grey databases were used to identify relevant articles. Based on
      fixed prostheses impression and fabrication methods, groups from each study were 
      categorized into 4 groups: conventional impression and fabrication (CC),
      conventional impression and digital fabrication (CD), digital scanning and
      conventional fabrication (DC), and digital scanning and fabrication (DD). The
      risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for clinical
      trials and the modified Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) 
      for in vitro studies. Heterogeneity was evaluated among studies, and
      meta-analysis was performed with random-effect models (alpha=.05). Subgroup
      analysis was conducted when possible. RESULTS: Eight clinical trials and 21 in
      vitro studies were eligible for analysis. There was no significant difference
      between the CD and DD clinical groups for marginal adaptation (P=.149); However, 
      the DD group had significantly less internal discrepancy than the CD group
      (P=.009). The in vitro studies found no significant difference in marginal
      adaptation among the CC-CD, CC-DC, and CC-DD pairs (P=.437, P=.387, P=.587), but 
      in the comparison CD versus DD group, a significantly better marginal adaptation 
      was observed for the DD group (P=.001). All the compared in vitro groups were
      similar in terms of internal adaptation. CONCLUSIONS: Impression and fabrication 
      techniques may affect the accuracy of fit of complete-coverage fixed
      restorations. A completely digital workflow yielded restorations with comparable 
      or better marginal adaptation than the other methods.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance of
      fatigued lithium disilicate pressed zirconia crowns versus other ceramic crowns. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lithium disilicate pressed zirconia, fluorapatite pressed 
      zirconia, monolithic lithium disilicate, and monolithic zirconia crowns were
      fabricated. Cyclic and static loadings were applied to the mesiobuccal cusp tip
      after thermocycling and fracture strengths were recorded. RESULTS: Fatigued
      lithium disilicate pressed zirconia crowns were found to have a fracture
      resistance of 9,117.81 +/- 727.04 N, compared with 9,240.61 +/- 887.21 N for
      monolithic zirconia crowns, 3,030.18 +/- 1,505.83 N for fluorapatite pressed
      zirconia crowns, and 4,173.94 +/- 877.46 N for monolithic lithium disilicate
      crowns (P = .001). CONCLUSION: This in vitro study shows that fatigued lithium
      disilicate pressed zirconia and monolithic zirconia crowns have better fracture
      resistance than fluorapatite pressed zirconia and monolithic lithium disilicate
      crowns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical experience suggests that there is a difference in survival
      between anterior and posterior all ceramic restorations. OBJECTIVES: This
      systematic review compared the difference in survival for full coverage
      all-ceramic materials used in adults to restore anterior or posterior vital
      teeth, not involved with fixed dental prostheses, but opposed by teeth. DATA AND 
      SOURCES: Searches using Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, including hand
      searches, with the inclusion criteria containing all-ceramic full coverage crowns
      in human adults over 17 years of age, prospective and retrospective studies,
      opposed by teeth, periodontal pocketing </=5mm, but not involving implant
      supported crowns or non-vital teeth. All papers were published between 1980 and
      March 2014 and available in English. From the selected studies a meta analysis
      was undertaken. The chi square test, I(2), Begg's and Egger's test were analysed 
      and the publication bias was assessed using a Funnel plot. The, Kappa scores were
      0.63, 0.88, and 0.81 at each selection stage. STUDY SELECTIONS: Pooled data
      produced 1112 anterior crowns with 73 failures (6.5%) and 1821 posterior crowns
      with 166 failures (9.1%) with a follow up time from 36 to 223 months. Relative
      risk meta-analysis of the 14 selected papers demonstrated that anterior
      all-ceramic crowns were 50% less likely to fail than posterior all-ceramic crowns
      (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that there were differences in
      failure between anterior and posterior all ceramic crowns but the difference was 
      only 3%. Although this has clinical relevance and some caution is needed when
      prescribing all ceramic posterior crowns the difference was relatively small.
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The clinically relevant results of this review, based on
      currently available data, demonstrate a need for some caution when considering
      posterior all-ceramic crowns. Lithium disilicate restorations were observed to
      have higher failures on anterior restorations and more research is needed to
      investigate why.

TI  - Micro-CT and Microscopy Study of Internal and Marginal Gap to Tooth Surface of
      Crenelated versus Conventional Dental Indirect Veneers.
LID - 772 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina57080772 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: Ceramic veneers represent the most appropriate
      treatment option for minimally invasive aesthetic rehabilitation. For long-term
      clinical success, the accurate marginal and internal adaptation of dental
      restorations are of paramount importance. The aim of this in vitro study is to
      assess the effect of a novel (patented) design of veneers compared to
      conventional ones on their marginal and internal gap to the prepared tooth
      surface. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four lithium disilicate ceramic veneers
      are obtained using Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) and then milled using
      Computer-Aided-Manufacturing (CAM). The samples are divided into two groups: 12
      conventional (CO) veneers (i.e., with a linear marginal contour) and 12
      crenelated (CR) veneers, the latter with the novel sinusoidal marginal design.
      All samples are bonded to frontal teeth, and the adhesive interfaces are analyzed
      using two methods, optical microscopy and micro-Computed Tomography (CT): the
      former for the accuracy of the marginal gap and the latter for the internal gap
      (as well as for the homogeneity of the luting cement) of ceramic veneers.
      Results: STATA and one-way ANOVA tests reveal significant differences between CO 
      and CR veneers: (i) the marginal gap is smaller for CR (64 mum) than for CO
      veneers (236 mum); (ii) the internal adaptation is better for CR veneers: for a
      cement width of up to 120 mum, the covered surface for the CR group is 81.5%,
      while for the CO group it is 64.5%; (iii) the mean of the porosities within the
      cement is not significantly different (3.4.10(6) mum(3) for CO and 3.9.10(6)
      mum(3) for CR veneers), with a higher standard deviation for the CO group.
      Analytical modeling is achieved for internal gaps using the micro-CT results. The
      characteristic functions obtained allow us to compare the volume of luting cement
      for the two types of veneers. Conclusion: The novel veneers design produces an
      improvement in the marginal and internal adaptation of the restorations to the
      prepared tooth surface. Thus, it provides favorable premises for better clinical 
      performances.

TI  - Longitudinal study of pressed glass-ceramic inlays for four and a half years.
PG  - 346-53
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Some restorative materials used in the posterior region of 
      the mouth present conventional problems, such as microleakage, recurrent caries, 
      wear, and poor color stability. PURPOSE: This study determined the reliability of
      the IPS Empress ceramic material for fabricating inlays and onlays in the
      posterior region of the mouth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 125 IPS Empress
      pressed glass ceramic inlays were placed for 29 patients in a private practice.
      The restorations were observed for a period of 7 to 56 months, with a mean of
      40.3 months. All inlays were constructed in the same dental laboratory and the
      restorative materials used according to the manufacturers' instructions. The
      restorations were evaluated clinically according to modified U.S. Public Health
      Service criteria at the time of insertion and at periodic recall appointments.
      Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to calculate survival rates. RESULTS: Clinical 
      evaluation revealed that pressed glass ceramic inlays, with the exception of four
      fractured restorations, were rated from Alpha to Bravo for each criteria.
      Marginal discoloration recorded the lowest percentage of alpha ratings (65.3%).
      The estimated survival rate after approximately a 4.5-year follow-up period was
      95.63% (95% confidence interval; 90.77% to 99.95%).

TI  - The marginal fit of E.max Press and E.max CAD lithium disilicate restorations: A 
      critical review.
PG  - 835-844
AB  - This critical review aimed to assess the vertical marginal gap that was present
      when E.max lithium disilicate-based restoration (Press and CAD) are fabricated
      in-vitro. Published articles reporting vertical marginal gap measurements of
      in-vitro restorations that had been fabricated from E.Max lithium disilicate were
      sought with an electronic search of MEDLINE (PubMed) and hand search of selected 
      dental journals. The outcomes were reviewed qualitatively. The majority of
      studies that compared the marginal fit of E.max press and E.max CAD restorations,
      found that the E.max lithium disilicate restorations fabricated with the press
      technique had significantly smaller marginal gaps than those fabricated with CAD 
      technique. This research indicates that E.max lithium disilicate restorations
      fabricated with the press technique have measurably smaller marginal gaps when
      compared with those fabricated with CAD techniques within in-vitro environments. 
      The marginal gaps achieved by the restorations across all groups were within a
      clinically acceptable range.

TI  - Success and Survival of Various Types of All-Ceramic Single Crowns: A Critical
      Review and Analysis of Studies with a Mean Follow-Up of 5 Years or Longer.
PG  - 168-181
LID - 10.11607/ijp.4703 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this critical review was to assess the survival and success
      rates of all-ceramic single crowns manufactured using different ceramic materials
      with a mean follow-up time of 5 years or longer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An
      electronic search of studies published between 1980 and 2014 complemented by
      manual searching was conducted in Medline and Scopus. The terms ceramic, crown,
      survival, success, longevity, and complications were selected as keywords.
      Predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria guided the search. Data were
      extracted and assessed by two independent reviewers. The results were
      statistically analyzed according to the type of material, and survival/success
      rate was calculated by assuming a Poisson-distributed number of events. RESULTS: 
      The initial search yielded 972 articles. After subsequent filtering, 14 studies
      were selected. The inter-reviewer agreement was rated as good (kappa = 0.65) and 
      very high agreement (kappa = 0.93) during the identification and screening
      phases, respectively. No studies on densely sintered zirconia or feldspathic
      crowns satisfied the minimum follow-up time. Only one study of each of the
      following materials satisfied the inclusion criteria: lithium disilicate, leucite
      reinforced, pressed Al(2)O(3), and sintered Al(2)O(3). Meta-analysis of the
      included studies on other materials resulted in the following estimated survival 
      and success rates: for densely sintered alumina crowns, 93.8% and 92.75%,
      respectively; for fluoromica reinforced, 87.7% and 87.7%, respectively; and for
      glass-infiltrated alumina core, 94.4% and 92%, respectively. Crown fracture was
      considered the most frequent complication. CONCLUSION: Based on the present
      critical review, there was no evidence to support the superior application of a
      single ceramic system or material. Further long-term prospective studies are
      required.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of indirect resin composite and ceramic onlays over a
      24-month period.
PG  - 329-34
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical performance of ceramic and 
      indirect resin composite onlays over a 24-month period. A total of 94 onlay
      restorations in 47 patients were included in this study. Cavities were prepared, 
      full-arch impressions were taken, and onlays were fabricated in the laboratory.
      All restorations were placed with a dual-cured luting resin composite system.
      Restorations were evaluated at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
      Differences between Alpha scores were analyzed statistically. The recall rate of 
      this study was 93.6%. At the six-month evaluation, one onlay failed due to
      pulpitis. Other than the color match, there was no significant difference between
      indirect resin composite and ceramic onlays (p > 0.05). For indirect resin
      composites, Alpha score differences pertaining to color match, marginal
      adaptation, and surface texture were found to be statistically significant (p <
      0.05) between the baseline and the 24-month recall. For ceramic restorations,
      marginal adaptation criteria was the only significant difference over the
      24-month period (p < 0.05). At the end of 24 months, both indirect resin
      composite and ceramic onlays were considered to be successful clinically.

TI  - Clinical performance and failures of zirconia-based fixed partial dentures: a
      review literature.
PG  - 76-83
LID - 10.4047/jap.2012.4.2.76 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Zirconia has been used in clinical dentistry for approximately a decade,
      and there have been several reports regarding the clinical performance and
      survival rates of zirconia-based restorations. The aim of this article was to
      review the literatures published from 2000 to 2010 regarding the clinical
      performance and the causes of failure of zirconia fixed partial dentures (FPDs). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search of English peer-reviewed dental
      literatures was performed through PubMed to obtain all the clinical studies
      focused on the performance of the zirconia FPDs. The electronic search was
      supplemented by manual searching through the references of the selected articles 
      for possible inclusion of some articles. Randomized controlled clinical trials,
      longitudinal prospective and retrospective cohort studies were the focuses of
      this review. Articles that did not focus on the restoration of teeth using
      zirconia-based restorations were excluded from this review. RESULTS: There have
      been three studies for the study of zirconia single crowns. The clinical outcome 
      was satisfactory (acceptable) according to the CDA evaluation. There have been 14
      studies for the study of zirconia FPDs. The survival rates of zirconia anterior
      and posterior FPDs ranged between 73.9% - 100% after 2 - 5 years. The causes of
      failure were veneer fracture, ceramic core fracture, abutment tooth fracture,
      secondary caries, and restoration dislodgment. CONCLUSION: The overall
      performance of zirconia FPDs was satisfactory according to either USPHS criteria 
      or CDA evaluations. Fracture resistance of core and veneering ceramics, bonding
      between core and veneering materials, and marginal discrepancy of zirconia-based 
      restorations were discussed as the causes of failure. Because of its repeated
      occurrence in many studies, future researches are essentially required to clarify
      this problem and to reduce the fracture incident.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic review was to calculate the 5-yr survival rates of
      all-ceramic zirconia-based fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) and to analyze
      technical and biological complications. An electronic literature search of
      MEDLINE (PubMed) was conducted independently by three reviewers to identify
      clinical studies from 1999 to 2009 and was completed by a manual search. Keywords
      and inclusion and exclusion criteria were well-defined. The search revealed 399
      titles and led to the final analysis of 18 full-text articles. Nine studies met
      the inclusion criteria. Extracted data were statistically calculated into 5-yr
      survival rates and 5-yr complication-free rates by using Poisson regression
      analysis. In total, 310, 3- to 4-unit FDPs and 20 FDPs with more than 4 units
      were included. The estimated 5-yr survival rate for all FDPs was 94.29% (95% CI: 
      58.98-99.32); 19 FDPs were lost as a result of catastrophic failures. The 5-yr
      complication-free rate regarding technical complications was 76.41% (95% CI:
      42.42-91.60) with chipping being the most frequent complication. Regarding
      biological complications, the 5-yr complication-free rate was 91.72% (95% CI:
      59.19-98.53). The survival rates of zirconia-based short-unit FDPs are promising.
      However, an important improvement of the veneering systems is required, and for
      FDPs with more units in function, further randomized, controlled clinical trials 
      are necessary.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Ceramic single crowns fabricated from newer materials,
      especially zirconia, have shown relatively high survival rates. However, early
      reversible complications may increase the risk of an irreversible failure later. 
      PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the early complications and
      short-term failures of zirconia single crowns and partial fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs) made by predoctoral dental students. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were
      collected from the patient records. Altogether, 264 zirconia single crowns and
      120 FDPs (342 abutments and 190 pontics) were fabricated for 173 patients between
      2007 and 2010. Early complications were recorded during the prosthetic treatment 
      phase, and short-term failures were recorded during the first year in use.
      RESULTS: The most frequent early complications were localized gingival irritation
      (1.9% of single crowns and 2.5% of FDP) and postoperative tooth sensitivity (0.4%
      of single crowns and 3.3% of FDPs). Pulp exposure during preparation was recorded
      in 3 abutment teeth of the FDPs. The most frequent short-term failure was
      chipping of the veneering porcelain (0.8% for single crowns, 0.8% for FDPs). One 
      crown lost cementation because of poor retention (0.4%), and 2 FDPs failed
      because of framework fractures (1.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent early
      complications were localized gingival irritation and postoperative tooth
      sensitivity, and the most frequent short-term failure was chipping of the
      veneering porcelain.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Evidence is limited on the efficacy of zirconia-based fixed
      dental prostheses. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systemic review was to assess
      zirconia-based FDPs in terms of survival and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Searches performed in PubMed databases were enriched by hand searches to identify
      suitable publications. The keywords used were: ""zirconia"" and ""fixed dental
      prosthesis,"" ""zirconia"" and ""crown,"" ""zirconia"" and ""fixed partial denture"" and
      ""humans,"" ""zirconia"" and ""crown"" and ""humans,"" ""crown"" and ""all-ceramics,"" and
      ""fixed partial denture"" and ""all-ceramics"". Titles and abstracts were read to
      identify literature that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Only peer reviewed
      clinical studies published in the English language from January 1999 through June
      2011 were included. RESULTS: Twelve clinical studies based on zirconia, framework
      design, and porcelain veneering technique met the inclusion criteria. Of the
      studies identified, 1 was a randomized clinical study with 3-year follow-up
      results; the others were cohort prospective studies. Clinical complications
      included chipping of veneering porcelain, abutment failure, and framework
      fracture. One study investigated pressed ceramics as the veneering material and
      found no chipping of veneering porcelain after 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Short term
      clinical data suggest that zirconia-based fixed dental prostheses may serve as an
      alternative to metal ceramic fixed dental prostheses in the anterior and
      posterior dentition.

PG  - 232-8
LID - 10.1016/S0022-3913(12)60067-5 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: There is less information on the quality of fit of zirconia
      frameworks with or without ceramic veneer than on anatomically contoured milled
      zirconia restorations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to
      evaluate the strain development of CAD/CAM fabricated zirconia ceramic frameworks
      with and without ceramic veneering, copy-milled zirconia ceramic frameworks, and 
      copy-milled zirconia ceramic anatomic contour restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Four groups of 3-unit implant-supported cement-retained restorations were
      fabricated (n=10) to fit an in vitro model with 2 implants. Strain gauges which
      recorded the strain development of all restorations during cementation were
      attached to the model mesially and distally adjacent to the implants. Mean
      absolute strain values were recorded for statistical analysis (MANOVA with
      Pillai's trace; alpha=.05). RESULTS: Mean absolute strain development at the
      different strain gauge locations ranged from 83.23 microm/m for copy-milled
      zirconia ceramic anatomic contour restorations to 301.20 microm/m for veneered
      CAD/CAM fabricated zirconia ceramic restorations. Significant effects (P<.001) of
      the fixed factors restoration type and veneering status, as well as of their
      interaction term (P=.001) were found. Ceramic veneering of CAD/CAM frameworks
      resulted in higher strain development, whereas the greater volume in copy-milled 
      anatomic contour restorations did not affect accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: With the
      systems used in this study, zirconia ceramic-based anatomic contour restorations 
      show greater passivity of fit than ceramic veneered CAD/CAM fabricated zirconia
      ceramic frameworks.

      posterior fixed dental prostheses: a 3-year follow-up.
PG  - 553-60
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to test whether posterior fixed dental
      prostheses (FDPs) with zirconia frameworks exhibit similar survival rates and
      technical and biologic outcomes as those with metal frameworks. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Fifty-nine patients in need of 76 FDPs replacing one to three posterior 
      teeth (molars and premolars) were included in the study. The three- to five-unit 
      FDPs were randomly assigned to 38 zirconia-ceramic and 38 metal-ceramic FDPs. At 
      baseline, 6 months, and 1 to 3 years after cementation, the technical outcome of 
      the reconstructions was examined using the United States Public Health Service
      (USPHS) criteria. The biologic outcome was analyzed at test (abutment) and
      control (contralateral) teeth by assessing: probing pocket depth (PPD), probing
      attachment level (PAL), plaque control record (PCR), bleeding on probing (BOP),
      and tooth vitality. Radiographs of the FDPs were made. Statistical analysis was
      performed by applying Kaplan-Meier, Pearson chi-square, Fisher exact, and
      Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with 67 FDPs (36
      zirconia-ceramic, 31 metal-ceramic) were examined after a mean observation period
      of 40.3 +/- 2.8 months. Six patients with 9 FDPs were lost to follow-up. The
      survival of both kinds of FDPs was 100%. No significant differences regarding the
      technical and biologic outcomes were found. Minor chipping of the veneering
      ceramic was found in 25% of the zirconia-ceramic and 19.4% of the metal-ceramic
      FDPs. Extended fracturing of the veneering ceramic occurred solely in
      zirconia-ceramic FDPs (C: 8.6%, D: 2.8% [USPHS criteria]). Few biologic
      complications were found. Both types of FDPs rendered the same mean values for
      the biologic parameters (mean PPD, PCR, and BOP for zirconia-ceramic FDPs = 2.4
      +/- 0.3, 0.1 +/- 0.1, and 0.3 +/- 0.2, respectively; mean PPD, PCR, and BOP for
      metal-ceramic FDPs = 2.4 +/- 0.3, 0.1 +/- 0.1, and 0.3 +/- 0.2, respectively).
      CONCLUSION: Zirconia-ceramic FDPs exhibited a similar survival rate to
      metal-ceramic FDPs at 3 years of function.

TI  - Prospective Evaluation of Posterior Fixed Zirconia Dental Prostheses: 10-Year
      Clinical Results.
PG  - 35-42
LID - 10.11607/ijp.5283 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical survival and success rates of conventionally
      luted three- and four-unit fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with zirconia
      frameworks (Cercon Smart Ceramics, DeguDent) after a mean observation period of
      119 +/- 36 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 75 patients were treated in 
      the Department of Prosthodontics at the University of Goettingen, Germany, and a 
      total of 99 posterior FDPs were inserted and luted with zinc phosphate cement.
      Time-dependent survival and success rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier
      curves, and their relationships with the type of veneer (ceramic), location
      (maxilla vs mandible), and span length (three-unit vs four-unit) were analyzed
      with a Cox regression model (P < .05). RESULTS: Of the 99 inserted FDPs, 24 were 
      lost to follow-up, 51 remained functional and passed the 10-year examination
      (overall survival rate: 75.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 0.85), and 13 
      were absolute failures caused by technical events (technical survival rate: 84%; 
      95% CI: 0.64, 0.85). In 50 FDPs, relative failure required a clinical
      intervention to maintain function (overall success rate: 40%; 95% CI: 0.29,
      0.52). For 35 of these FDPs, the relative failure was caused by technical events 
      (technical success rate: 61%; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.73). None of the evaluated factors 
      showed an association with overall or technical survival or success. CONCLUSION: 
      Zirconia-based posterior FDPs produced with a first-generation computer-assisted 
      manufacturing (CAM) system revealed high rates of absolute and relative failure, 
      mainly due to technical events, after a mean observational period of 10 years.
      Further clinical studies with updated computer-assisted design (CAD)/CAM systems 
      are needed to determine the long-term performance of zirconia-based FDPs.

TI  - Fracture resistance and failure mode of endodontically treated teeth restored
      using ceramic onlays with or without fiber posts-an ex vivo study.
PG  - 328-35
LID - 10.1111/edt.12252 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to compare the fracture resistance and fracture modes of
      ceramic onlay restorations with or without fiber posts in endodontically treated 
      premolars. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty extracted human premolars with similar
      anatomic features were used in this study. Four groups (n = 10) were treated
      endodontically. Onlay cavities extended to the buccal and palatal cusps and
      reached out the endodontic accesses were prepared. Ceramic onlay restorations
      with or without fiber posts were categorized as Group CO (ceramic onlays without 
      posts), Group COQF (ceramic onlays and quartz fiber posts), and Group COGF
      (ceramic onlays and glass fiber posts). Positive control group was left as
      non-restored (Group NR). Ten intact teeth were stored as negative control group
      (Group IT). Fracture resistance was measured using a universal load-testing
      machine applying compressive load at a crosshead speed of 1 mm min(-1) until
      fracture. Fracture resistance and modes were evaluated statistically. RESULTS:
      Ceramic onlay restorations (Groups CO, COQF, COGF) increased the fracture
      resistance significantly, when compared with non-restored teeth (P < 0.05).
      However, no significant differences were found in the groups with fiber posts in 
      terms of fracture resistance (P > 0.05). Negative control group (IT) had
      significantly higher fracture resistance than all others (P < 0.05). Fracture
      types had significant differences among the groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Within the limitations of this ex-vivo study, partial coverage with ceramic
      onlays resulted in a significant improvement of the fracture resistance of
      endodontically treated premolars. However, insertion of glass or quartz fibers
      did not increase the fracture resistance significantly.

TI  - [Cast partial restorations: outdated!].
PG  - 442-4
AB  - The decision to apply a certain therapy is the outcome of a process in which the 
      advantages and disadvantages of this therapy are weighed and compared to
      alternative therapies. Key words in this process are effectiveness and
      efficiency. Comparison of inlays and onlays with direct resin composite
      restorations in terms of effectiveness and efficiency suggests that inlays and
      onlays are more effective (more durable) than direct resin composite
      restorations. In contrast, resin composite restorations require fewer resources
      and thus may be more efficient. However the value of a therapy is not only
      determined by quantitative measures. It is suggested that appropriateness and
      adequacy of a therapy should be considered as well. If restorative treatment
      using cast partial restorations is compared with a treatment using direct resin
      composite restorations, the latter is considered more appropriate because of its 
      conservative approach. Both types of restorations are considered adequate in
      terms of protecting the tooth and restoring its function.

TI  - Zirconia crowns cemented on titanium bars using CAD/CAM: a five-year follow-up
      prospective clinical study of 9 patients.
PG  - 286
LID - 10.1186/s12903-019-0988-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate
      clinical results of the passive fit of the substructure in the Toronto bridge and
      the chipping or delamination of the ceramic veneering on the zirconia-support,
      after 5 years, in nine patients rehabilitated with zirconia crowns cemented on
      titanium bars using CAD/CAM technology. METHODS: A total of nine healthy patient 
      fully edentulous in the upper and lower jaws with non-contributory past medical
      anamnesis needing full fixed total prosthesis maxilla and mandible were included 
      in this clinical study, where a total 9 mandibles and 9 jaws were treated. The
      inclusion criteria in order for a patient to participate in the study were: a
      signed consent form, fully edentulous in the upper and lower jaws, required a
      full fixed total prosthesis restoration. The exclusion criteria were age
      limitation of less than 18 years old, chemotherapy, head and neck radiation
      therapy, diabetes or periodontal disease, smoking and severe illness. All
      patients received zirconia crowns cemented on titanium bars using CAD/CAM
      technology. The primary outcome of this study was to examine the survival rate of
      the zirconia crowns cemented on titanium bars using CAD/CAM technology during the
      observation period. Any chipping or delamination of the zirconia crowns of the
      restorations was considered as failure. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the
      passive fit of the substructure on the implants, loose of occlusal screws,
      implant survival and satisfactory occlusion. RESULTS: In 5 years of follow-up no 
      evidence of chipping or delamination of the ceramic veneering on the zirconia
      crown supported were observed. Fifteen finished protesis (93.75%) showed
      satisfactory occlusion and only one case (6.25%) required significant occlusal
      adjustment. During the first year recall all bars were stable (100%) no mobility 
      of protheses was recorded. After 5 years all bars were stable (100%) and no
      mobility of protheses was recorded. CONCLUSION: The computerized workflow for the
      process of building bar and prosthesis ensures reproducible results and excellent
      adaptation and passive insertion of them, as well as conditions for avoiding
      mechanical complications and guarantees stability of screw-implant abutments.

TI  - Influence of misfit on the occurrence of veneering porcelain fractures (chipping)
      in implant-supported metal-ceramic fixed dental prostheses: an in vitro pilot
      trial.
PG  - 1381-1387
LID - 10.1111/clr.12997 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Technical complications such as veneer fractures are more common in
      implant-supported than tooth-supported restorations. The underlying causes have
      not been fully identified. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether misfit
      between the restoration and the implant may affect the risk of veneer fractures. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty standardized five-unit implant-supported
      metal-ceramic fixed dental prostheses (FDP)s were manufactured and fixed in
      acrylic blocks. The test group consisted of ten FDPs fixed with a 150-mum misfit 
      at the distal abutment. The remaining ten FDPs were fixed without misfit and
      acted as a control group. All FDPS underwent cyclic loading for a total of
      100,000 cycles at 30-300 N. The FDPs were checked for cracks or chip-off
      fractures regularly. After cyclic load, the retorque value of all abutment screws
      was checked. RESULTS: Cracks within the veneering porcelain were noted in nine
      FDPs in the test group and one FDP in the control group. This difference was
      statistically significant (P < 0.001). Fractures of the veneering porcelain
      occurred in three FDPs in the test group. No fractures occurred in the control
      group. This difference was not statistically significant. There were no
      significant differences in retorque values neither between the groups nor between
      different abutment positions in the FDPs. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of 
      this in vitro pilot trial, it is suggested that misfit between a restoration and 
      the supporting implant may increase the risk of cracking and/or chipping of the
      veneering porcelain for metal-ceramic FDPs.

AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study aimed to evaluate fracture resistance in lithium
      disilicate onlays fabricated with IPS e.max Press and IPS e.max CAD systems and
      luted with different adhesive cements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty maxillary
      first molars were prepared using a mesio-occluso-disto-lingual onlay cavity
      model. Ten onlays from each group were cemented using etch-and-rinse adhesives
      and high-viscosity composite resin cement, and 10 were cemented with
      self-adhesive, dual-curing universal resin cement. Fracture resistance was
      measured. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between resin cements (p
      < 0.05) and between materials (p < 0.05), but the interaction of these variables 
      did not produce a significant difference. The fracture resistance of pressable
      ceramics was significantly higher than that of CAD/CAM onlays (p < 0.05), and
      Syntac Variolink was significantly higher than that of Multilink Sprint (p <
      0.05). CONCLUSION: All groups showed clinically acceptable fracture strength
      results. According to the study, both the onlay fabrication system and adhesive
      cements can be a viable treatment option.

TI  - Computer-aided technology for fabricating removable partial denture frameworks: A
      systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A consensus that establishes the indications and clinical
      performance of removable partial denture (RPD) frameworks designed and
      manufactured with computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD-CAM) systems is lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and 
      meta-analysis was to evaluate the currently published literature investigating
      different CAD-CAM methods and techniques for RPD manufacturing and their clinical
      performance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of studies published up
      to September 2019 was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane
      Library, and SciELO databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA Statement) criteria and was
      registered and approved in the International Prospective Register of Systematic
      Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42020152197). The population, intervention, comparison,
      outcome (PICO) question was ""Do the CAD-CAM frameworks have similar performances 
      to those fabricated by conventional techniques?"" The meta-analysis included
      clinical and in vitro studies based on the effect size and test of Null (2-Tail) 
      with 95% confidence interval (CI). Clinical and in vitro studies were selected
      and analyzed separately. RESULTS: A total of 15 articles out of 358 were
      selected. For clinical studies, quantitative analysis with a sample of 25
      participants showed a mean discrepancy between occlusal rests and rest seats of
      184.91 mum (95% CI: 152.6 mum-217.15 mum) and heterogeneity (I(2)) of 0%.
      Clinical data considered that frameworks were acceptable for continuity of
      treatment. The predominant materials were cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) and
      polyetheretherketone (PEEK), and studies using Co-Cr reported that the structure 
      required adjustments. In addition, it has been reported that the indirect
      technique was time-consuming and selective laser melting (SLM) can be costly.
      PEEK structures have been more widely accepted because of improved esthetics.
      Quantitative data from the in vitro studies revealed that the additive
      manufacturing technique (2.006 mm: 95% CI: -2.021 mm to 6.032 mm) was not
      significantly different from the indirect technique (0.026 mm; P=.455; random:
      I(2): 98.402%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies and in vitro research on CAD-CAM
      planning and manufacturing of removable prosthesis frameworks are still sparse.
      However, preliminary data indicate a similar fit and esthetic improvement when
      compared with the conventional technique.

TI  - Ten-year outcome of three-unit fixed dental prostheses made from monolithic
      lithium disilicate ceramic.
PG  - 234-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a prospective study to evaluate the long-term
      outcome of crown-retained fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) made from monolithic
      lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan,
      Liechtenstein). METHODS: Faculty dentists at the Department of Prosthodontics,
      Propaedeutics and Dental Materials, School of Dentistry, Christian-Albrechts
      University at Kiel, Germany, placed 36 three-unit FDPs in 28 patients to replace 
      six anterior and 30 posterior teeth. The proximal connector size (height and
      width) was 4 x 3 millimeters for anterior FDPs and 4 x 4 mm for posterior FDPs.
      FDPs were cemented either conventionally with glass ionomer cement (n = 19) or
      adhesively with resin-based composite (n = 17). Patients made annual recall
      visits. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) observation period was 121 (12.8) 
      months. FDPs' survival rate (survival being defined as remaining in place either 
      with or without complications) was 100 percent after five years and 87.9 percent 
      after 10 years, and their success rate (success being defined as remaining
      unchanged and free of complications) was 91.1 percent after five years and 69.8
      percent after 10 years. The cementation method did not affect the outcome.
      CONCLUSION: Three-unit FDPs made from monolithic lithium disilicate ceramic
      showed five- and 10-year survival and success rates that were similar to those of
      conventional metal-ceramic FDPs. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: If the manufacturer's
      recommendations are followed, three-unit FDPs made from monolithic lithium
      disilicate ceramic may be a safe alternative to metal-ceramic FDPs regardless of 
      the cementation method used.

TI  - Comparison of marginal and internal fit of pressed lithium disilicate veneers
      fabricated via a manual waxing technique versus a 3D printed technique.
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12675 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the marginal and
      internal fit of pressed lithium disilicate veneers fabricated from a 3D printed
      castable wax resin versus a manual waxing technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      typodont model central incisor was prepared for a porcelain veneer. Following
      stone model fabrication from a polyvinyl siloxane impression, the model was
      digitized using a laboratory scanner. Group 1 veneers were designed digitally and
      3D printed with a castable wax resin, then pressed. Group 2 veneers were
      fabricated using a manual wax and press approach. Veneers from both groups were
      bonded to printed dies. Following measurements of marginal adaptation under a
      stereo microscope, the dies were sectioned and measurements were made for
      internal adaption. Statistical analysis included a Kolmogorov test and a
      Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Average marginal gap (mum) for Group 1 was 40.37
      +/- 11.75 and 50.63 +/- 16.99 for Group 2 (p = 0.51). Average internal gap (mum) 
      for Group 1 was 61.21 +/- 18.20 and 68.03 +/- 14.07 for Group 2 (p = 0.178).
      CONCLUSION: There was no difference in marginal fit or internal fit between
      pressed lithium disilicate veneers fabricated with a 3D printed castable resin
      and those fabricated with a manual waxing technique. The use of digital
      technologies and 3D printing provide significant advantages in the fabrication of
      pressed glass ceramic veneers, with marginal and internal adaptation comparable
      to manual wax and press techniques.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical
      long-term outcome over 15 or more years of crown-retained fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs) made from a lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent 
      AG). METHODS: Thirty-six three-unit FDPs replacing anterior (16%) and posterior
      (84%) teeth were inserted in 28 patients. Abutment teeth were prepared following 
      a standardized protocol. The size of the proximal connector of the FDPs was
      12mm(2) (anterior) or 16mm(2) (posterior). FDPs were cemented either
      conventionally with glass-ionomer cement (n=19) or adhesively with composite
      resin (n=17). The following parameters were evaluated at baseline, 6 months after
      cementation and then annually (at abutment and contralateral teeth): probing
      pocket depth, plaque index, bleeding on probing, and tooth vitality. RESULTS:
      Three FDPs were defined as drop-outs. The mean observation period of the
      remaining 33 FDPs was 167 months (range: 79-225 months). The survival rate
      (survival being defined as FDPs remaining in place either with or without
      complications) according to Kaplan-Meier was 48.6% after 15 years. The success
      rate (success being defined as free of complications and remaining unchanged) was
      30.9% after 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and crack propagation caused by
      clinical aging in monolithic lithium disilicate ceramics seem to take
      considerable time, as shown by the presented survival and success rates after 15 
      years. Further long-term studies are necessary to evaluate the reliability of
      FDPs made from other all-ceramic materials over a period of 15 or more years.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term survival and complication rates of
      posterior three-unit fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) fabricated from a
      glass-infiltrated zirconia reinforced alumina ceramic (In-Ceram Zirconia).
      METHODS: Fifty-eight patients received 65 FDPs. Twelve FDPs replaced the second
      premolar (8 in the maxilla, 4 in the mandible), and 53 replaced the first molar
      (19 in the maxilla, 34 in the mandible). The In-Ceram Zirconia ceramic frameworks
      were designed and milled using the Cerec CAD/CAM system. The minimum dimension of
      the proximal connectors of the frameworks was 12 mm(2) and 16 mm(2) for premolars
      and molars, respectively. After milling and glass infiltration, the frameworks
      were veneered with a feldspathic ceramic. All FDPs were cemented with
      glass-ionomer cement. The patients were recalled 6-12 months after placement, and
      then annually. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the survival and
      complication rates of the FDPs. RESULTS: The mean observation time was 9.7 years.
      Six patients with 6 FDPs were regarded as dropouts. Using the Kaplan-Meier method
      the 10-year cumulative survival rate was 93.6%. In a worst-case scenario, in
      which the 6 missing FDPs are considered as failed, the 10-year survival rate
      would be 84.6%. CONCLUSION: Three-unit posterior FDPs made from In-Ceram Zirconia
      presented a 10-year survival rate similar to that reported for conventional FDPs.
      However more technical and biological complications were reported. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: Three-unit posterior FDP made from In-Ceram Zirconia may be a
      viable treatment modality, taking the strict adherence to the manufacturer's
      recommendations into consideration.

AB  - The stronger the ceramic material, the longer the restoration stays in the mouth.
      The current study evaluated the two-year clinical performance of a strong ceramic
      system, IPS Empress II, with increased strength on onlay/inlay restorations of
      molars. Teeth from 35 patients, including three premolars and 32 molars, were
      prepared for 28 onlay and seven inlay restorations with IPS Empress II ceramics. 
      The restorations were cemented with a highly viscous, dual-curing luting
      composite cement (Bifix) and evaluated by two examiners using USPHS criteria at
      baseline (one week following insertion), six months, one year and two years. The 
      baseline scores and recalls were assessed by Wilcoxon signed rank test.
      Statistically significant marginal discoloration at the Bravo level was found at 
      the 12- and 24-month recalls (p=0.046). One debonding was statistically
      insignificant. No changes were observed with respect to anamnesis, such as any
      symptom from the TMJ or masticatory muscles. No restorations were replaced due to
      hypersensitivity or were missing at the two-year evaluation. Any wear on the
      restoration, antagonist tooth or any changes of proximal contacts were not
      observed. IPS Empress II Ceramics were found to be appropriate as onlay/inlay
      restorations for clinical use under the conditions of the current study.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of veneered zirconia anterior partial fixed dental prostheses: 
      A 12-year prospective clinical trial.
LID - S0022-3913(20)30714-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.09.046 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Anterior veneered zirconia partial fixed dental prostheses 
      (FDPs) have substituted for metal-ceramic to improve esthetics and
      biocompatibility. However, the material is susceptible to aging or hydrothermal
      degradation and to chipping of the feldspathic veneer. Whether these
      susceptibilities limit the clinical performance of anterior veneered zirconia
      FPDs is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to
      analyze the mechanical and biologic behavior of zirconia partial FDPs in the
      anterior region over a 12-year follow-up period. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Twenty-seven 3- to 6-unit FDPs fabricated from zirconia veneered with feldspathic
      porcelain were placed in the anterior region and examined clinically at 1 month, 
      6 months, and then annually for 12 years, recording mechanical and biologic
      outcomes. Raw complication rates and time-to-event Kaplan-Meier analysis was
      conducted and compared as per the partial fixed dental prosthesis type. RESULTS: 
      Five FDPs had biologic complications (3 with secondary caries, 1 with periapical 
      pathology, 1 with periodontal disease) and 9 had mechanical complications (7 with
      chipping and 2 with decementation). Chipping was the most prevalent complication 
      and increasingly found with longer-span fixed partial prostheses (P=.007). Five
      FDPs had to be replaced because of complete failure, the most frequent cause of
      failure being secondary caries (P=.003). The mean survival rate (no failures) was
      11 years 4 months (95% confidence interval, 10.3-12.7). CONCLUSIONS: Zirconia
      FDPs had an 81.5% survival rate over 12 years. A higher incidence of
      complications took place during the first 3 years, the most common being
      chipping.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Endodontic access preparation through a lithium disilicate 
      restoration is a frequently encountered clinical situation. The common practice
      of repairing the accessed crown with composite resin may result in a weakened
      restoration. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine the
      effect of endodontic access preparation on the fracture resistance and
      microstructural integrity of monolithic pressed and monolithic milled lithium
      disilicate complete coverage restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty
      monolithic pressed (IPS e.max Press) and 20 monolithic milled (IPS e.max CAD)
      lithium disilicate restorations were fabricated. Ten of the pressed and 10 of the
      milled crowns were accessed for a simulated endodontic treatment and subsequently
      repaired by using a porcelain repair system and composite resin. All specimens
      were submitted to cyclic loading and then loaded to failure. Force data were
      recorded and analyzed with 2-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc test (Sidak
      correction) to indicate significant differences among the groups (alpha=.05). A
      Weibull analysis was also performed for each group. Eight (4 pressed and 4
      milled) additional restorations were fabricated to complete a scanning electron
      microscope (SEM) analysis and evaluate the surface damage created by the
      endodontic access preparation. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference
      (P=.019) was found between the pressed intact and pressed repaired restorations
      and between the pressed intact and milled repaired restorations (P=.002).
      Specimens that were examined with an SEM showed edge chipping involving primarily
      the glaze layer around the access openings. CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic access
      preparation of lithium disilicate restorations resulted in a significantly
      reduced load to failure in the pressed specimens, but not in the milled
      specimens.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the marginal and internal adaptation of partial
      coverage crowns (ceramic onlays) fabricated with Press, CEREC BlueCam, and CEREC 
      OmniCam systems, using two preparation designs and evaluating the internal
      discrepancies at different locations. Two phantom maxillary premolars (master
      teeth) received different preparation designs, with (BX) and without (NB) a
      modified occlusal box with round internal angles. Sixty IPS e-max ceramic
      restorations were fabricated with three systems: Press (n=20), CEREC BlueCam
      (n=20), and CEREC OmniCam (n=20). Both marginal and internal discrepancy width
      were measured by using a stereomicroscope at x25 magnification. The data were
      evaluated statistically using analysis of variance followed by Tukey's Honestly
      Significant Difference test (alpha=0.05). The ceramic restorations fabricated
      with the Press system presented significantly smaller marginal and internal
      disadaptations than the BlueCam and OmniCam CEREC systems (p<0.0001). Regarding
      the preparation designs, preparation BX presented the smallest marginal
      discrepancies for all fabrication systems and larger internal discrepancies than 
      for restorations fabricated with the Press system. The occlusal location
      presented a larger internal discrepancy compared with the axial locations.
      Although the three systems resulted in the fabrication of restorations within a
      clinically acceptable adaptation with marginal discrepancies below 100 mum, the
      Press system presented the smallest marginal and internal discrepancies. An
      improved marginal adaptation was observed in the preparation design with a
      modified occlusal box with rounded internal angles.

TI  - Survival of Dicor glass-ceramic dental restorations over 14 years. Part II:
      effect of thickness of Dicor material and design of tooth preparation.
PG  - 662-7
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The influence of different restorative design features on
      the long-term survival of Dicor glass-ceramic restorations is not well
      understood. PURPOSE: This study examined the relationship of different types of
      restorations and methods of preparation with the survival of Dicor glass-ceramic 
      restorations functioning in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1444 Dicor
      glass-ceramic restorations were placed on the teeth of 417 adults. Failure was
      defined as a restoration that required remake because of material fracture.
      Survival of restorations of different types and with different methods of
      preparation was described by using Kaplan Meier survivor functions. Statistical
      significance between restoration type and preparation method was determined with 
      the log rank test. RESULTS: Probability of survival of a typical partial coverage
      restoration was 92% at 11.3 years. There was no statistically significant
      difference between the survival of inlay or onlay restorations. For the 91 cores 
      used for pulpless teeth, none failed over a total cumulative monitoring period of
      419 years. There was no significant difference in survival of acid-etched Dicor
      restorations that were placed on shoulder or chamfer preparations. Thickness
      measured at the midpoint of the labial, lingual, mesial, distal, and midocclusal 
      surfaces did not relate to risk of failure. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Dicor
      glass-ceramic partial coverage inlay and onlay restorations and cores survived
      over time. Survival of restorations with either chamfer or shoulder preparations 
      did not differ whether the restoration was acid-etched. Thickness of the
      restoration measured at the midaxial point of each surface did not relate to
      survival.

PG  - 104-111
LID - 10.1080/26415275.2021.1932510 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The primary objective of this systematic review is to compare the
      fracture resistance of lithium disilicate (LDS)-based endocrowns and resin-based 
      (RB) endocrowns of in-vitro studies, and the secondary objective is to compare
      their catastrophic failures. Materials and Methods: The review protocol was
      registered in the P ROSP ERO database (CRD42020166201). A comprehensive
      literature search was done in PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar
      using key terms. Only in-vitro studies that compared fracture resistance of
      LDS-based endocrowns and indirect RB endocrowns in molars were included. Data
      extraction, risk of bias assessment and qualitative analysis of the included
      studies were performed. Results: Five studies were included in this systematic
      review. The overall risk of bias for the included studies was moderate. Under
      axial loading, RB endocrowns showed similar fracture resistance when compared
      with LDS endocrowns. However, they showed better fracture resistance when
      compared with zirconia reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) endocrowns. Furthermore,
      RB endocrowns showed fewer catastrophic failures than LDS-based endocrowns.
      Conclusions: RB endocrowns have similar or better fracture resistance and fewer
      catastrophic failures when compared to LDS-based endocrowns.

TI  - 3D and 2D marginal fit of pressed and CAD/CAM lithium disilicate crowns made from
      digital and conventional impressions.
PG  - 610-7

AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study evaluated the 3D and 2D marginal fit of pressed and 
      computer-aided-designed/computer-aided-manufactured (CAD/CAM) all-ceramic crowns 
      made from digital and conventional impressions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      dentoform tooth (#30) was prepared for an all-ceramic crown (master die). Thirty 
      type IV definitive casts were made from 30 polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impressions. 
      Thirty resin models were produced from thirty Lava Chairside Oral Scanner
      impressions. Thirty crowns were pressed in lithium disilicate (IPS e.max Press;
      15/impression technique). Thirty crowns were milled from lithium disilicate
      blocks (IPS e.max CAD; 15/impression technique) using the E4D scanner and milling
      engine. The master die and the intaglio of the crowns were digitized using a 3D
      laser coordinate measurement machine with accuracy of +/-0.00898 mm. For each
      specimen a separate data set was created for the Qualify 2012 software. The
      digital master die and the digital intaglio of each crown were merged using
      best-fitting alignment. An area above the margin with 0.75 mm occlusal-gingival
      width circumferentially was defined. The 3D marginal fit of each specimen was an 
      average of all 3D gap values on that area. For the 2D measurements, the marginal 
      gap was measured at two standardized points (on the margin and at 0.75 mm above
      the margin), from standardized facial-lingual and mesial-distal digitized
      sections. One-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference and
      two-way ANOVA tests were used, separately, for statistical analysis of the 3D and
      2D marginal data (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed that both 3D and
      2D mean marginal gap for group A: PVS impression/IPS e.max Press (0.048 mm +/-
      0.009 and 0.040 mm +/- 0.009) were significantly smaller than those obtained from
      the other three groups (p < 0.0001), while no significant differences were found 
      among groups B: PVS impression/IPS e.max CAD (0.088 mm +/- 0.024 and 0.076 mm +/-
      0.023), C: digital impression/IPS e.max Press (0.089 mm +/- 0.020 and 0.075 mm
      +/- 0.015) and D: digital impression/IPS e.max CAD (0.084 mm +/- 0.021 and 0.074 
      mm +/- 0.026). The results of two-way ANOVA revealed a significant interaction
      between impression techniques and crown fabrication methods for both 3D and 2D
      measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of PVS impression method and press
      fabrication technique produced the most accurate 3D and 2D marginal fits.

TI  - In-vivo evaluation of a feldspathic ceramic system: 2-year results.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate feldspathic ceramic
      inlays by clinical criteria and quantitative margin analysis, and to compare
      clinical performance with the quantitative margin analysis results. METHODS:
      Fifty fibre-reinforced feldspathic ceramic inlays were placed in box-shaped,
      Class II preparations with all margins located in enamel. A low-viscosity type
      dual-curing resin luting material was used for luting. The inlays were evaluated 
      clinically according to modified US Public Health Service criteria after 2 days, 
      1 year, and 2 years. In addition, quantitative margin analysis was performed
      under a scanning electron microscope using an image analysing system. RESULTS:
      Clinically the inlays performed very well after 2 years, showing no changes in
      colour, no recurrent caries and no marginal discolouration. Because of the wear
      of the composite resin luting material, margins were perceptible with an explorer
      in 54% of the cases after 2 years. Quantitative margin analysis showed
      significantly (P < or = 0.05) more marginal gaps at the composite/ceramic
      interface compared with the enamel/composite interface at each evaluation. There 
      was a significant increase in marginal gaps at both interfaces during the first
      year, whereas marginal gaps at the composite/ceramic interface did not increase
      significantly during the second year. Quantitative margin analysis showed that
      both time and interface had a significant influence on marginal gaps. CONCLUSION:
      Quantitative margin analysis should be included in clinical long-term trials on
      this type of restoration to recognize possible deficiencies in ceramic, composite
      resin luting material, and the luting interfaces.

TI  - A Systematic Review of the Survival and Complication Rates of All-Ceramic
      Resin-Bonded Fixed Dental Prostheses.
PG  - 535-543
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12678 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the survival and
      complication rates of all-ceramic resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses (RBFDPs). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were applied. A systematic search was conducted
      by an electronic search in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CNKI databases
      complemented by a manual search. Only clinical studies on all-ceramic RBFDPs with
      a mean follow-up period of at least 3 years qualified for data analyses. RESULTS:
      Among 1503 screened articles, one randomized controlled trial (RCT) and seven
      prospective or retrospective cohort studies were included in this study. The
      estimated 5-year survival rate of all-ceramic RBFDPs was 91.2%. Debonding and
      framework fracture were the two most frequent technical complications, and the
      estimated 5-year debonding rate and fracture rate were 12.2% and 4.8%,
      respectively. Additionally, cantilevered all-ceramic RBFDPs had a higher survival
      rate (p < 0.01), lower debonding rate, (p < 0.05), and fracture rate (p < 0.01)
      compared with two-retainer all-ceramic RBFDPs. Zirconia ceramic RBFDPs had a
      lower incidence of failure but a higher debonding rate compared with
      glass-ceramic RBFDPs (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this
      systematic review, although all-ceramic RBFDPs have a favorable 5-year survival
      rate, this rate cannot represent the complete success of the treatment, since it 
      may include typical complications such as debonding and fractures. There is an
      urgent need for long-term clinical studies, especially for well-designed RCTs on 
      all-ceramic RBFDPs.

TI  - Effect of Split-File Digital Workflow on Crown Margin Adaptation.
PG  - 571-580
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12606 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) is becoming
      increasingly integrated into dental practice workflow at a pace that exceeds
      scientific validation. The aim of this study is to evaluate a complete digital
      split-file protocol relative to segmental digital and analog techniques for
      restoring a single maxillary anterior edentulous space with custom abutment and
      crown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four treatment workflows were assessed: complete
      digital (CD), segmental digital (SD), milled wax (AM), and heat pressed and hand 
      waxed (AH) and heat pressed. The CD workflow ""split"" an abutment and crown into
      separate files to fabricate a zirconia abutment and both zirconia/lithium
      disilicate crown restorations. The SD workflow scanned the existing abutment for 
      design of segmental restorations in zirconia, lithium disilicate, and milled wax 
      (AM). The AH specimens were conventionally hand waxed. Both the AM and AH
      specimens were heat pressed with lithium disilicate. All restorations were
      evaluated with standardized measurements using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
      as manufactured without internal adjustments and after manual adjustment. The
      number of adjustments, adjustment time, and location of adjustments were
      recorded. One-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to report geometric means
      with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The mean marginal gap after adjustment of
      the CD group was 69 mum, with an upper bound (UB) of 79 mum and a lower bound
      (LB) of 60 mum. SD group mean was 26 mum with an UB of 31 mum and LB of 22 mum.
      The AM group mean was 32 mum, with an UB of 49 mum and a LB of 20 mum; AH group
      mean of 26 mum with an UB of 34 mum and a LB of 20 mum. The SD, AM, and AH
      workflows were statistically similar (p = 1.000), and the CD workflow was
      statistically greater than the other three (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The
      split-file (CD) protocol results in marginal gap size within clinical standards
      after adjustment; however, 52 of the 60 digitally produced restorations showed a 
      horizontal marginal offset that required adjustment for proper contours.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the marginal and internal cement thicknesses of inlay
      restorations made of various CAD/CAM materials using 3D X-ray micro-computed
      tomography (micro-CT) technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Caries-free extracted
      mandibular molars (N = 30) with similar size were randomly assigned to three
      groups (N = 10 per group). Mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) cavities were prepared,
      and inlay restorations were obtained by milling out CAD/CAM materials namely, (a)
      IPS: monolithic lithium disilicate (control), (b) VE: polymer-infiltrated
      ceramic, and (c) CS: nano-ceramic using a CAM unit. Marginal and internal cement 
      thicknesses were measured using 3D micro-CT. Data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA
      and Tukey's tests (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: The mean marginal and internal cement 
      thickness were not significant in all inlay materials (p > 0.05). Mean marginal
      cement thickness (mum) was the lowest for the IPS group (67.54 +/- 10.16)
      followed by VE (84.09 +/- 3.94) and CS (95.18 +/- 10.58) (p > 0.05). The internal
      cement thickness (mum) was the lowest in the CS group (54.85 +/- 6.94) followed
      by IPS (60.58 +/- 9.22) and VE (77.53 +/- 12.13) (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Marginal
      and internal cement thicknesses of MOD inlays made of monolithic lithium
      disilicate, polymer-infiltrated ceramic, and nano-ceramic CAD/CAM materials were 
      similar and all less than 100 mum, which could be considered clinically
      acceptable. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: MOD inlays made of different CAD/CAM materials
      presented similar cement thickness, less than 100 mum.

TI  - In Vivo and In Vitro Comparison of Internal and Marginal Fit of Digital and
      Conventional Impressions for Full-Coverage Fixed Restorations: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 236-254

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate digital and conventional impressions for
      full-coverage restorations in terms of marginal and internal discrepancies. STUDY
      SELECTION: The analysis included in vivo and in vitro studies reporting the
      marginal or internal gap of full-coverage restorations that provide both the
      conventional and digital impression. The PubMed, Cochrane Trials, and Scopus
      databases were searched. The quality of clinical trials was rated using Cochrane 
      Collaboration's tool, and the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the
      Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool.
      Heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated, and a meta-analysis with subgroup 
      analysis was conducted whenever it was possible. RESULTS: Thirty-three articles
      (8 prospective clinical trials and 26 in vitro studies) were selected to extract 
      data after applying the predefined selection criteria. The standard mean
      difference (SMD) of the meta-analysis for marginal adaptation was -0.76 (95%
      confidence interval: -1.23 to -0.29) and -0.59 (95% confidence interval: -0.93 to
      -0.24) for in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively, indicating digital
      impressions provided significantly less marginal gap than conventional
      impressions in in vitro studies (P = .002). The impression technique did not
      significantly influence the internal adaptation. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in
      marginal adaptation between the digital and conventional groups are not
      significant for in vivo studies, but for in vitro studies, the digital impression
      resulted in better marginal adaptation. Based on the Grading of Recommendations, 
      Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for marginal adaptation,
      clinical studies were classified as high confidence and in vitro studies were
      graded moderate because of the inconsistency. Furthermore, high-quality studies
      are needed to confirm our results (the International Prospective Register of
      Systematic Reviews; CRD42017077925).

TI  - A systematic review of outcome measurements and quality of studies evaluating
      fixed tooth-supported restorations.
PG  - 421-33
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12160 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to review clinical studies of 
      fixed tooth-supported prostheses, and to assess the quality of evidence with an
      emphasis on the assessment of the reporting of outcome measurements. Multiple
      hypotheses were generated to compare the effect of study type on different
      outcome modifiers and to compare the quality of publications before and after
      January 2005. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search was conducted using
      specific databases (MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, Cochrane Library) through 
      July 2012. This was complemented by hand searching the past 10 years of issues of
      the Journal of Oral Rehabilitation, Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry, Journal of
      Prosthodontics, and the International Journal of Prosthodontics. All experimental
      and observational clinical studies evaluating survival, success, failure, and
      complications of tooth-supported extracoronal fixed partial dentures, crowns, and
      onlays were included. No restrictions on age or follow-up time were placed.
      RESULTS: The electronic search generated 14,869 papers, of which 206 papers were 
      included for full-text review. Hand-searching added 23 papers. Inclusion criteria
      were met by 182 papers and were included for the review. The majority were
      retrospective studies. Only 8 (4.4%) were randomized controlled trials. The
      majority of the studies measured survival and failure, and few studies recorded
      data on success; however, more than 60% of the studies failed to define survival,
      success, and failure. Many studies did not use any standardized criteria for
      assessment of the quality of the restorations and, when standardized criteria
      were used, they were modified, thereby not allowing for comparisons with other
      studies. There was an increase of 21.8% in the number of studies evaluating
      outcome measurements of all-ceramic restorations in past 8 years. CONCLUSIONS:
      Prosthodontic literature presents with a reduced percentage of RCTs compared to
      other disciplines in dentistry. The overall quality of recording prosthodontic
      outcome measurements has not improved greatly in the past 8 years.

      review.
PG  - 157-167
LID - 10.5395/rde.2017.42.3.157 [doi]
AB  - This systematic review aims to summarize the current clinical studies that
      investigated survival rates against fracture of endodontically treated posterior 
      teeth restored with crowns or resin composite restorations. Literature search
      were performed using keywords. Publications from 1980 to 2016 were searched in
      PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS. Included studies were
      selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three clinical studies were
      included: 1 randomized controlled trial and 1 prospective and 1 retrospective
      cohort studies. Pooled survival rates ranged from 94%-100% and 91.9%-100% for
      crowns and resin composite, respectively. The majority of teeth had no more than 
      3 surface loss of tooth structure. The studies included were heterogeneous, and
      were not appropriate for further meta-analysis. Current evidence suggested that
      the survival rates against the fracture of endodontically treated posterior teeth
      restored with crowns or resin composites were not significantly different in the 
      teeth with minimum to moderate loss of tooth structure.

TI  - Utilization of Ceramic Inlays for Sealing Implant Prostheses Screw Access Holes: 
      A Case-Control Study.
PG  - 1142-9
LID - 10.11607/jomi.4733 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a case control study, the
      esthetic and functional clinical performance of ceramic inlays used for covering 
      the screw access hole in single monolithic lithium disilicate full-contour crowns
      bonded on computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)
      prefabricated titanium abutments in order to eliminate the drawbacks of
      alternative restorative methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients
      with missing teeth in the lateral areas (premolars and molars) received
      screw-retained implant restorations. In half of the restorations (n = 14),
      composite fillings were used to seal the access hole (control group), while the
      other half was sealed with ceramic inlays (test group). To determine the
      restoration occlusal wear, impressions were obtained after the restorations were 
      finalized, at 1 year, and at 2 years follow-up. The casts were scanned with a 3D 
      Scanner Design System recording the anatomical surfaces of the white model
      replicates. Wear amounts (mum) were calculated as the maximum loss in height of
      the occlusal surface. The clinical evaluation was carried out using a kit
      specifically designed for assessing the FDI criteria. Statistics were performed
      using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: A total of 58 restorations were
      delivered, and after 2 years of follow-up, the wear values were 228.20 +/- 54.68 
      mum for the control group and 65.20 +/- 7.24 mum for the ceramic inlay group.
      One-way ANOVA showed significant differences among the vertical loss between
      these two groups (P < .001). Clinical outcomes according to the FDI score for
      assessing dental restorations revealed substantial deterioration within 2 years
      of follow-up. CONCLUSION: The use of ceramic inlays appears to be a predictable, 
      esthetic, and successful method of sealing the screw holes of the screw-retained 
      implant restorations.

TI  - Marginal and internal fit of pressed lithium disilicate partial crowns in vitro: 
      a three-dimensional analysis of accuracy and reproducibility.
PG  - 320-6
LID - 10.1016/j.dental.2011.12.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this in vitro study was to visualize and to quantify
      the marginal and internal fit of heat-pressed ceramic restorations by a novel
      three-dimensional procedure. Accuracy and reproducibility of the employed
      measuring method were determined. METHODS: An acrylic model of a lower left first
      molar was prepared to receive a partial crown and duplicated by single step dual 
      viscosity impressions. Corresponding working casts were formed from Type IV die
      stone and indirect restorations were fabricated from heat-pressable lithium
      disilicate ceramics (IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan,
      Liechtenstein). The acrylic tooth model and the ceramic partial crowns were
      digitized by a structure light scanner with a measurement-uncertainty of 4 mum
      and subjected to computer-aided quality inspection. Visual discrepancies in
      marginal and internal fit were displayed with colors. For quantitative analysis, 
      mean quadratic deviations (RMS) were computed and analyzed by Student's t-test
      (n=5, alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Mean RMS-values for accuracy (reproducibility) ranged
      from 34 (14) mum for internal areas to 78 (23) mum for marginal surfaces.
      Differences in accuracy (p=0.003) and reproducibility (p<0.001) were
      statistically significant. In general, areas with sharp internal line angles such
      as occlusal ridges and the preparation finish line exhibited oversized
      dimensions, whereas areas with rounded and soft internal line angles were
      undersized. SIGNIFICANCE: The viability of a computer-aided and three-dimensional
      approach for assessing marginal and internal fit of indirect restorations was
      demonstrated. Thereby, the obtained results track complex form changes as they
      occur during laboratory processing.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The survival and/or success of post-retained restorations
      is influenced by the amount of residual coronal structure, known as the ""ferrule 
      effect."" PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to 
      evaluate whether the presence or absence of the ferrule effect influences the
      failure rate of fiber-reinforced composite post-and-core restorations. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed using the
      PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases for articles
      published up to May 2018. The risk ratio with 95% confidence interval was
      estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Potentially eligible studies were
      selected based on the reading of the abstracts and full text of prospective
      clinical trials, randomized clinical trials, or prospective randomized studies,
      all with a minimum of 10 participants in each group, with a follow-up period
      longer than 6 months, and published in English. RESULTS: Of the 380 studies
      retrieved, 4 were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 297 teeth were
      evaluated, 157 with a ferrule and 140 without a ferrule. The mean survival rate
      was 88.35% in the ferrule group and 78.05% in the nonferrule group. No
      statistically significant difference was noted in the general failure analysis
      (risk ratio: 0.71 [95% confidence interval: 0.47 to 1.06]; P=.09), although a
      higher number of failures occurred in nonferrule restorations. More controlled
      and randomized clinical trials are needed to establish a clinical protocol for
      the use of post-retained restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited number of
      available studies, the results of this meta-analysis suggest that the ferrule
      effect does not significantly reduce the failure rate in fiber-reinforced
      composite post-and-core restorations.

TI  - Stereomicroscopic Evaluation of Marginal Fit of E.Max Press and E.Max
      Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Assisted Manufacturing Lithium Disilicate
      Ceramic Crowns: An In vitro Study.
PG  - 178-184
LID - 10.4103/jispcd.JISPCD_18_19 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the marginal gap of E-max
      press, and E.max computer-aided design and computer-assisted manufacturing
      (CAD-CAM) lithium disilicate (LD) ceramic crowns fabricated by using conventional
      technique and CAD-CAM technique. Materials and Methods: This was an in vitro
      experimental study carried out in Riyadh Elm University and King Saud University.
      A marginal gap of 30 LD crowns was evaluated by Stereomicroscopy. A total of 15
      pressable LD (IPS E.max Press [Ivoclar Vivadent]) ceramic crowns were fabricated 
      by using conventional lost wax pattern method (Group A). Digital impressions of
      the prepared dies were scanned and transferred to the milling machine. IPS E.max 
      CAD (IPS E-max, Ivoclar, Amherst, NY, USA) LD blocks in shade Vita A2 were then
      milled by using DWX-50 machine for CAD-CAM crowns (Group B). Descriptive
      statistics of mean and standard error of marginal gaps for both groups were
      recorded and compared by applying Mann-Whitney U-test. All the data were analyzed
      by using statistical analysis software SPSS version 21.0 (Armonk, NY, USA: IBM
      Corp). Results: The LD crowns prepared by CAD-CAM technology (26.80 +/- 3.4 mum) 
      had significantly lower (P < 0.001) marginal gap than the LD pressed crowns (38.8
      +/- 2.3 mum) fabricated by conventional technique. The marginal gaps between
      CAD-CAM versus conventional groups exhibited significant differences at (42.68
      mum vs. 52.46 mum, U = 51.500, P = 0.011), Mesiobuccal (15.94 mum vs. 30.13 mum, 
      U = 45.500, P = 0.005), distolingual (26.70 mum vs. 43.86 mum, U = 63.500, P =
      0.042), and distal (12.38 mum vs 31.45 mum, U = 47.500, P = 0.006). Conclusions: 
      Within the limitations of the study, it can be concluded that LD all ceramic
      crowns fabricated by using CAD-CAM techniques showed lesser marginal gap and
      better marginal fit compared to the conventional technique.

      analysis.
PG  - 403-409
LID - 10.1111/jerd.12574 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effects of the scanning techniques and the
      crystallization in the internal and marginal adaptation of milled lithium
      disilicate crowns by two techniques computer microtomography analysis. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Sixteen polyurethane teeth prepared for a complete crown were
      divided into two groups according to the scanner method (n = 8): indirect (IND), 
      dental stone models were scanned with laser-surface scanner, and direct (DIR),
      digital typodont creates with an intraoral scanner. Internal and marginal gap
      were evaluated by micro-computed tomography (microCT). The replica technique (RT)
      was applied for analysis of total volume (TV) and marginal volume (MV) gap in
      microCT. The data showed normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test). One-way ANOVA
      (scanner techniques) with repeated measures (crystallization) was performed.
      Multiple comparisons were performed with Bonferroni adjustment (alpha = .05).
      RESULTS: The axial gap showed a significant difference between the times (P =
      .017) for lower values after crystallization. The vertical marginal gap presented
      a significant difference in times for higher value after crystallization (P =
      .001). The marginal horizontal gap IND was greater than DIR after crystallization
      (P = .001) and IND before lower than after crystallization. For TV was not
      significant difference and MV in DIR was reduction (P = .002) after
      crystallization. CONCLUSION: Crystallization changes the relationship between the
      crown and tooth, reducing internal gap and preventing the adequate fit in
      indirect and direct scanning. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The measure gap under
      technological methodology is useful for adjust clinical parameters prosthetic in 
      the CAD/CAM and the applicability of the new possibilities of analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 10-year clinical
      performance of zirconia-based inlay-retained fixed dental prostheses (IRFDP).
      METHODS: For replacement of a molar in 27 patients, 30 IRFDP were luted by use of
      different cements, Panavia F (Kuraray Europe GmbH) or Multilink Automix (Ivoclar 
      Vivadent GmbH), with use of inlay/inlay, inlay/full-crown, or inlay/partial-crown
      retainers for anchorage. Frameworks were milled from yttria-stabilized zirconia
      (IPS e.maxZirCAD; Ivoclar Vivadent GmbH) and fully veneered with pressable
      ceramic (IPS e.max ZirPress; Ivoclar Vivadent GmbH). Before luting, the IRFDP
      were silica-coated (Rocatec; 3M Espe) and silanized (Monobond S; Ivoclar Vivadent
      GmbH). Complications (for example, chipping or delamination of the veneering
      ceramic, debonding, secondary caries, endodontic treatment, and abutment tooth
      fracture) and failure were reported, by use of standardized report forms, 2
      weeks, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 10 years after cementation. Statistical analysis
      included Kaplan-Meier survival and success (complication-free survival) and Cox
      regression analysis (alpha=0.05 for all). RESULTS: During the 10-year observation
      period, the complications most often observed were chipping of the veneer and
      debonding. Twenty-five restorations failed and one participant dropped out.
      Cumulative 10-year survival and success were 12.1% and 0%, respectively. The
      design of the retainer, use of a dental dam, choice of cement, and location in
      the dental arch had no statistically significant effect on the occurrence of
      complications. CONCLUSIONS: Use of fully veneered zirconia-based IRFDP with this 
      technique cannot be recommended. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A large incidence of
      complications and poor survival were observed for fully veneered zirconia-based
      IRFDP, revealing an urgent need for further design improvements for this type of 
      restoration. This, again, emphasizes the need for testing of new restoration
      designs in clinical trials before implementation in general dental practice.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the clinical performance of lithium disilicate
      restorations supported by natural teeth or implants. Eight hundred sixty lithium 
      disilicate adhesive restorations, including crowns on natural teeth and implant
      abutments, veneers, and onlays, were made in 312 patients. Parafunctional
      patients were included, but subjects with uncontrolled periodontitis and gingival
      inflammation were excluded. Veneers up to 0.5 mm thick were luted with flowable
      composite resin or light curing cements, while dual-curing composite systems were
      used with veneers up to 0.8 mm thick. Onlays up to 2 mm in thickness were luted
      with flowable composite resins or dual-curing composite cements. Crowns up to 1
      mm in thickness were cemented with self-adhesive or dual-curing resin cements.
      The observational period ranged from 12 to 72 months, with a mean follow-up of 3 
      years. The mechanical and esthetic outcomes of the restorations were evaluated
      according to the modified California Dental Association (CDA) criteria. Data were
      analyzed with descriptive statistics. Twenty-six mechanical complications were
      observed: 17 porcelain chippings, 5 fractures, and 4 losses of retention.
      Structural drawbacks occurred mainly in posterior segments, and monolithic
      restorations showed the lowest number of mechanical complications. The clinical
      ratings of the successful restorations, both monolithic and layered, were
      satisfactory according to the modified CDA criteria for color match, porcelain
      surface, and marginal integrity. The cumulative survival rates of lithium
      disilicate restorations ranged from 95.46% to 100%, while cumulative success
      rates ranged from 95.39% to 100%. All restorations recorded very high survival
      and success rates. The use of lithium disilicate restorations in fixed
      prosthodontics proved to be effective and reliable in the short- and medium-term.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of ceramic inlays and onlays made with two systems: a
      one-year follow-up.
PG  - 333-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of
      ceramic inlays and onlays made with two systems: sintered (Duceram [D], DeguDent)
      and pressable (IPS Empress [IPS], Ivoclar-Vivadent) after 1 year. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Seventy-four restorations - 37 IPS and 37 D - were cemented in 34
      patients. Twenty-four premolars and 50 molars received Class II cavity
      preparations, totaling 28 onlays and 46 inlays. The restorations were evaluated
      by two independent investigators at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year, according to 
      modified USPHS criteria. Fisher and McNemar statistical tests were employed to
      assess the survival rate. RESULTS: After one year, 100% of the restorations were 
      assessed and all the restorations were considered clinically excellent or
      acceptable. Among the analyzed criteria, only the following received ""Bravo""
      ratings: marginal discoloration: IPS (24.32%), D (13.51%); marginal integrity:
      IPS (10.81%), D (8.11%); color match: IPS (5.41%), D (5.41%); surface texture:
      IPS (2.70%), D (10.81%). No ""Charlie"" or ""Delta"" scores were given to the
      restorations. CONCLUSION: Among the analyzed criteria, only marginal
      discoloration differed statistically significantly from the results of the
      baseline examination for IPS Empress ceramic restorations (p = 0.008). No
      significant differences were found between the two ceramics. The two ceramic
      systems demonstrated excellent clinical performance after a period of 1 year.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The best treatment option for large caries in permanent posterior
      teeth is still a matter of uncertainty in dental literature. The authors
      conducted a network meta-analysis to address the challenges related to
      rehabilitation of these teeth. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors selected
      prospective and retrospective studies that compared at least 2 different
      treatment alternatives for permanent teeth with a minimum of 5 years of
      follow-up. The authors searched databases from MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library,
      and Web of Science in October 2019 without language or year of publication
      restrictions. RESULTS: From 11,263 studies identified, 43 studies fulfilled the
      eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. Only 13 studies were 
      randomized controlled trials and were classified as low risk of bias. Gold
      (annual failure rate of 0.29%) and metal ceramic (annual failure rate of 0.52%)
      crowns performed better for indirect restorations and direct resin composite
      performed better for direct restorations (annual failure rate of 2.19%). The most
      substantial comparisons were between feldspathic and glass ceramics, followed by 
      direct resin composite and amalgam; there were no statistically significant
      differences between these interventions. Results of the pairwise meta-analysis
      showed mainly glass ionomer as significantly more prone to failure than amalgam
      and direct composite resin. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Reference
      standard direct and indirect materials except for glass ionomer can be used for
      restorations of large posterior caries.

TI  - A new system for posterior restorations: a combination of ceramic optimized
      polymer and fiber-reinforced composite.
PG  - 6-10
AB  - Due to the need for increased strength characteristics and enhanced aesthetic
      expectations of the patients, metal-free, aesthetic restorative systems for the
      anterior and posterior dentition are currently available. A new ""space-age""
      restorative material has been developed that is a combination of a ceramic
      optimized polymer (Ceromer) (Targis/Vectris, Ivoclar Williams, Amherst, NY) and a
      fiber-reinforced composite framework material. The purpose of this article is to 
      discuss the qualities that render this material particularly suitable for a
      variety of indications, including laboratory-fabricated restorations for the
      stress-bearing posterior regions. The material lends itself to diversification.
      Its indication for inlays, onlays, full-coverage crown restorations, and
      conservative single pontic inlay bridges is presented.

TI  - Computer-aided-design/computer-assisted-manufactured adhesive restoration of
      molars with a compromised cusp: effect of fiber-reinforced immediate dentin
      sealing and cusp overlap on fatigue strength.
PG  - 135-46
LID - 10.1111/j.1708-8240.2011.00433.x [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Cracked teeth may traditionally require the use of complete
      coverage crowns. Alternative conservative treatments involve the use of adhesive 
      inlays/onlays with the possibility of including a fiber patch to reinforce the
      cracked cusp. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fatigue
      strength of compromised molars restored with
      computer-aided-design/computer-assisted-manufactured (CAD/CAM) composite resin
      inlays/onlays with and without fiber-reinforced immediate dentin sealing (IDS).
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: Large mesio-occluso-distal preparations with
      cracked/undermined palatal cusps were simulated on 40 extracted maxillary molars.
      All teeth received IDS (Optibond FL, Kerr, Orange, CA, USA), and composite resin 
      (Paradigm MZ100, 3M-ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) inlays (N = 20) and onlays (N = 20).
      A fiber patch (Ribbond, Ribbond Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) was applied in half of
      the preparations. Restorations were adhesively luted with pre-heated composite
      resin (Z100, 3-M ESPE) and submitted to cyclic isometric loading at 5 Hz,
      starting with a load of 50 N (5,000 cycles), followed by stages of 150, 300, 450,
      600, 750, 900, and 1,050 N at a maximum of 25,000 cycles each. Specimens were
      loaded until fracture or to a maximum of 180,000 cycles. Groups were compared
      using the life table survival analysis. RESULTS: Differences in survival
      probability were found (p = 0.04). The inlay group with fiber patch failed at an 
      average load of 870 N, and none of the specimens withstood all 180,000 load
      cycles; survival rates of inlays and onlays without fibers, and onlays with
      fibers were 10, 30, and 50%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Onlays (with or without
      fibers) increased the fatigue resistance of compromised molars in this in vitro
      study.

PG  - 493-497
LID - 10.7518/hxkq.2018.05.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effect of pulp-less molars
      with defects of different degrees repaired by cast ceramic onlays of three
      marginal types. METHODS: A total of 165 endodontically treated molars of 105
      patients were included in this study and were divided into three kinds of defect 
      (mild, moderate, severe) according to the number of remaining axial walls. Each
      defect was divided into three groups according to the shape of edge to edge,
      bevel edge, and concave shoulder. After tooth preparation, the casting of ceramic
      onlays was performed. Treatment follow-up was done for the evaluation of the
      success and survival rates of three groups under the same defect. RESULTS: The
      average follow-up was 925.44 days. Under the mild defect, the success and
      survival rates of the edge to edge onlays were respectively 100% and 100%; bevel 
      edge onlays, 100% and 100%; and concave shoulder onlays, 94.4% and 100%. Under
      the moderate defect, the success and survival rates of the edge to edge onlays
      were respectively 96.0% and 100%; bevel edge onlays, 80.0% and 93.3%; and concave
      shoulder onlays, 95.2% and 95.2%. Under the severe defect, the success and
      survival rates of the edge to edge onlays were respectively 95.2% and 100%; bevel
      edge onlays, 73.7% and 89.5%; and concave shoulder onlays, 73.3% and 80.0%. Under
      different defects, the success or survival rates of the three kinds of onlays had
      no significant difference (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The edge to edge type is the
      most preferable way of onlay tooth preparation and can achieve good clinical
      results in the mild, middle, and severe tooth defection with root canal
      treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of ceramic onlay to repair serious defects in
      young permanent molars. METHODS: Sixty patients with defects in young permanent
      molars were selected. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. One
      group was restored with ceramic onlay, and the other used resin composite to
      direct filling. Follow-up visit was conducted at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after
      treatment. Modified USPHS/Ryge criteria were used to evaluate the effect of
      restoration. The occlusal courses were recorded by the T-Scan system in
      intercuspal position. Gingival and food impaction were recorded. The effect of
      the two restorative methods, the recovery of occlusal function, and the gingival 
      and approximal conditions were analyzed. RESULTS: At 12 months after restoration,
      the marginal fitness in the onlay group was significantly better than that in the
      resin group (P<0.05). At 12 and 24 months after restoration, the surface
      smoothness in the onlay group was significantly better than that in the resin
      composite group (P<0.05). At each follow-up visit, the resin group had
      significantly lower per-cen-tage of occlusal force than contralateral molar
      (P<0.05). The percentage of occlusal force in the onlay group and the
      con-trala-teral molar showed no statistical difference (P>0.05). The gingival and
      approximal conditions also demon-strated no stati-stical differences (P>0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: The ceramic onlay repair method is better than resin composite
      filling in marginal fitness, surface smoothness, and recovery of the occlusal
      function when restoring young permanent molars with serious defects.

TI  - Ceramic inlays for restoring posterior teeth.
PG  - CD003450
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent decades ceramic inlays have been used with the increasing
      requirements from patients for tooth-coloured restorations in posterior teeth.
      Ceramic inlays can offer an excellent appearance, however, their long-term
      prognosis is uncertain, as only a few studies have reported the long-term
      clinical performance of these restorations. OBJECTIVES: To compare the
      effectiveness of ceramic inlays in posterior teeth with other posterior
      restorations. SEARCH STRATEGY: We conducted an electronic search of the Cochrane 
      Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
      Trials ( The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from 1990 to
      2001. Handsearching included relevant journals and bibliographies of all relevant
      papers and review articles from 1990 up to 2001. In addition, we contacted
      experts and companies conducting clinical research on ceramic restorations to
      find other trials or unpublished materials or to clarify ambiguous or missing
      data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, in which the longevity of
      ceramic inlays is compared with those of other posterior restorations. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Screening of possible studies and data extraction were
      independently conducted by two reviewers (MH and AY) using a specially designed
      chart. Authors of studies were contacted for additional information. The
      methodological quality of studies was assessed in duplicate using individual
      components. The Cochrane Oral Health Group statistical guidelines were followed
      and the results expressed as Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval for
      dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies fulfilled the criteria to be
      included in the review. However, one of them was later excluded from the review, 
      as the study design was not clearly described. The remaining, included study,
      evaluated the clinical performance of 60 ceramic inlays and 20 gold inlays for
      five years. Seven of the 60 ceramic inlays and two of the 20 gold inlays failed
      at five-year review. No ceramic inlays resulted in postoperative pain/discomfort 
      after the treatment, however, one gold inlay did. The power of the included study
      was not great enough to detect an important difference in longevity and
      postoperative pain/discomfort between ceramic and gold inlays. REVIEWER'S
      CONCLUSIONS: There is no strong evidence available to support any differences in 
      the clinical performance of ceramic inlays and other posterior restorations.
      There is a limited number of well-designed clinical trials within this research
      area. Greater attention to the design and reporting of studies should be given to
      improve the study quality of ceramic restoration trials.

TI  - Bonding Strength of Universal Adhesives to Indirect Substrates: A Meta-Analysis
      of in Vitro Studies.
PG  - 298-308
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13147 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro bond strength of universal adhesive systems to 
      indirect substrates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two reviewers performed a literature
      search up to March 2018 in seven databases: PubMed, Web of Science, SciELO,
      Scopus, LILACS, IBECS, and BBO. The review included studies that compared the
      bond strength of universal adhesives and well-established material-specific
      primers to indirect substrates: lithium disilicate ceramic, yttrium-stabilized
      zirconium dioxide ceramic, leucite-reinforced ceramic, feldspathic porcelain,
      polymer infiltrated ceramic material, resin composite or metal alloys. Analyses
      were carried out using RevMan 5.3.5. A global comparison was performed with the
      standardized mean difference using a random-effects models at a significance
      level of p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies were included in the
      qualitative analysis, and the meta-analysis was performed with 42 studies. Bond
      strength to glass-based ceramics and alloys was improved with the use of a
      specific-primer as separate step before the bonding procedures (lithium
      disilicate, p < 0.001; alloys, p < 0.001). The bond strength to zirconium
      substrates was improved with the use of universal adhesives (p < 0.001). For bond
      strength to composite resin as indirect substrate, universal adhesives performed 
      in a manner similar to that of the material-specific primer (p = 0.11).
      CONCLUSIONS: The clinical procedure of luting zirconia and resin composite
      restorations could be simplified by using single-bottle universal adhesives.
      However, the ability of universal adhesives to achieve an adequate and durable
      bond to glass-based ceramics and alloys appears to be limited.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of ceramic inlays and onlays fabricated with two systems:
      12-year follow-up.
PG  - 1683-90
LID - 10.1007/s00784-015-1669-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the 12-year clinical
      performance of sintered (Duceram, Dentsply-Degussa, Dentsply International Inc., 
      PA, USA)-D and pressable (IPS Empress, Ivoclar-Vivadent, Schaan,
      Leichtenstein)-IPS ceramic inlay and onlay restorations. METHODS: Eighty-six
      restorations were placed in 35 patients with a median age of 33 years by a single
      operator. The restorations were luted with dual-cured resin luting material
      (Variolink II, Ivoclar-Vivadent, Schaan, Leichtenstein) and Syntac Classic
      adhesive under rubber dam. The evaluations were conducted by two independent
      investigators at the baseline, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 12 years using the modified USPHS 
      criteria. RESULTS: At the 12-year recall, 22 patients were evaluated (62.86 %),
      totalling 48 (55.81 %) restorations. Seven restorations were fractured (one from 
      Duceram and six from IPS), eight restorations presented secondary caries (three
      from Duceram and five from IPS), nine restorations showed unacceptable defects at
      the restoration margin and needed repair or replacement (two from Duceram and
      seven from IPS), and four IPS restorations presented pulp sensitivity.
      CONCLUSION: Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests revealed that IPS Empress system
      showed the best results for color match and surface texture (p < 0.05) but a
      significant worse result for fracture (p = 0.05). Wilcoxon test showed
      significant differences in relation to color match, surface texture, marginal
      discoloration, and marginal integrity between the baseline and 12-year recall for
      both ceramic systems. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This long-term clinical study
      observed that the main reasons for failure of ceramic restorations were related
      to fracture, recurrent caries, and decreased marginal integrity over time.
      Carefully monitoring of the ceramic-tooth interface may extend their clinical
      longevity.

TI  - Dental cavity liners for Class I and Class II resin-based composite restorations.
PG  - CD010526
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010526.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resin-based composite (RBC) is currently accepted as a viable
      material for the restoration of caries for posterior permanent teeth requiring
      surgical treatment. Despite the fact that the thermal conductivity of the RBC
      restorative material closely approximates that of natural tooth structure,
      postoperative hypersensitivity is sometimes still an issue. Dental cavity liners 
      have historically been used to protect the pulp from the toxic effects of some
      dental restorative materials and to prevent the pain of thermal conductivity by
      placing an insulating layer between restorative material and the remaining tooth 
      structure. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2016.
      OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of using
      dental cavity liners in the placement of Class I and Class II resin-based
      composite posterior restorations in permanent teeth in children and adults.
      SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the
      following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 12 November
      2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue
      10) in the Cochrane Library (searched 12 November 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 12
      November 2018), Embase Ovid (1980 to 12 November 2018) and LILACS BIREME Virtual 
      Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database;
      1982 to 12 November 2018). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health
      Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. 
      No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching
      the electronic databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled
      trials assessing the effects of the use of liners under Class I and Class II
      posterior resin-based composite restorations in permanent teeth (in both adults
      and children). We included both parallel and split-mouth designs. DATA COLLECTION
      AND ANALYSIS: We utilized standard methodological procedures prescribed by
      Cochrane for data collection and analysis. Two review authors screened the search
      results and assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion against the review 
      inclusion criteria. We conducted risk of bias assessments and data extraction
      independently and in duplicate. Where information was unclear we contacted study 
      authors for clarification. MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies, recruiting over 700
      participants, compared the use of dental cavity liners to no liners for Class I
      and Class II resin-based composite restorations.Seven studies evaluated
      postoperative hypersensitivity measured by various methods. All studies were at
      unclear or high risk of bias. There was inconsistent evidence regarding
      postoperative hypersensitivity (either measured using cold response or
      patient-reported), with a benefit shown at some, but not all, time points
      (low-quality evidence).Four trials measured restoration longevity. Two of the
      studies were judged to be at high risk and two at unclear risk of bias. No
      difference in restoration failure rates were shown at 1 year follow-up, with no
      failures reported in either group for three of the four studies; the fourth study
      had a risk ratio (RR) 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.00)
      (low-quality evidence). Three studies evaluated restoration longevity at 2 years 
      follow-up and, again, no failures were shown in either group.No adverse events
      were reported in any of the included studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is
      inconsistent, low-quality evidence regarding the difference in postoperative
      hypersensitivity subsequent to placing a dental cavity liner under Class I and
      Class II posterior resin-based composite restorations in permanent posterior
      teeth in adults or children 15 years or older. Furthermore, no evidence was found
      to demonstrate a difference in the longevity of restorations placed with or
      without dental cavity liners.

TI  - Ceramic inlays and onlays: update 1995.
PG  - 676-81
AB  - Tooth-colored inlays and onlays are increasingly sought by the public because of 
      a growing interest in restorations that appear natural, and because of concerns
      about mercury in amalgam fillings. Following the introduction of bonded porcelain
      inlays in 1985, many of these restorations were placed. These inlays were a
      natural sequel to the porcelain laminate that reached North America in 1984, yet 
      they did not enjoy the same rate of success. The advent of industrially
      fabricated porcelain blanks and the ability to copy-mill a positive as an inlay
      or onlay has resulted in a reliable and predictable dental restoration. Pressed
      ceramics, which are modelled by wax pattern, are also effective tooth-colored
      restorations.

TI  - Marginal Adaptation and Quality of Interfaces in Lithium Disilicate Crowns -
      Influence of Manufacturing and Cementation Techniques.
PG  - 185-195
LID - 10.2341/15-288-L [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the cement line thickness and the interface quality in
      milled or injected lithium disilicate ceramic restorations and their influence on
      marginal adaptation using different cement types and different adhesive
      cementation techniques. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-four bovine teeth were
      prepared for full crown restoration (7.0+/-0.5 mm in height, 8.0 mm in cervical
      diameter, and 4.2 mm in incisal diameter) and were divided into two groups:
      CAD/CAM automation technology, IPS e.max CAD (CAD), and isostatic injection by
      heat technology, IPS e.max Press (PRESS). RelyX ARC (ARC) and RelyX U200 resin
      cements were used as luting agents in two activation methods: initial
      self-activation and light pre-activation for one second (tack-cure). Next, the
      specimens were stored in distilled water at 23 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C for 72
      hours. The cement line thickness was measured in micrometers, and the interface
      quality received scores according to the characteristics and sealing aspects. The
      evaluations were performed with an optical microscope, and scanning electron
      microscope images were presented to demonstrate the various features found in the
      cement line. For the cement line thickness, data were analyzed with three-way
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Games-Howell test (alpha=0.05). For the
      variable interface quality, the data were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U-test, 
      the Kruskal-Wallis test, and multiple comparisons nonparametric Dunn test
      (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: The ANOVA presented statistical differences among the
      ceramic restoration manufacturing methods as well as a significant interaction
      between the manufacturing methods and types of cement (p<0.05). The U200
      presented lower cement line thickness values when compared to the ARC with both
      cementation techniques (p<0.05). With regard to the interface quality, the
      Mann-Whitney U-test and the Kruskal-Wallis test demonstrated statistical
      differences between the ceramic restoration manufacturing methods and cementation
      techniques. The PRESS ceramics obtained lower scores than did the CAD ceramics
      when using ARC cement (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Milled restorations cemented with
      self-adhesive resin cement resulted in a thinner cement line that is
      statistically different from that of CAD or pressed ceramics cemented with resin 
      cement with adhesive application. No difference between one-second tack-cure and 
      self-activation was noted.

TI  - Effect of feldspathic porcelain layering on the marginal fit of zirconia and
      titanium complete-arch fixed implant-supported frameworks.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Veneering with porcelain may adversely affect the marginal 
      fit of long-span computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM)
      implant-supported fixed prostheses. Moreover, data regarding the precision of fit
      of CAD-CAM-fabricated implant-supported complete zirconia fixed dental prostheses
      (FDPs) before and after porcelain layering are limited. PURPOSE: The purpose of
      this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of porcelain layering on the
      marginal fit of CAD-CAM-fabricated complete-arch implant-supported,
      screw-retained FDPs with presintered zirconia frameworks compared with titanium. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: An autopolymerizing acrylic resin-fixed complete denture
      framework prototype was fabricated on an edentulous typodont master model
      (all-on-4 concept; Nobel Biocare) with 2 straight in the anterior and 2 distally 
      tilted internal-hexagon dental implants in the posterior with multiunit abutments
      bilaterally in canine and first molar locations. A 3-dimensional (3D) laser
      scanner (S600 ARTI; Zirkonzahn) was used to digitize the prototype and the master
      model by using scan bodies to generate a virtual 3D CAD framework. Five
      presintered zirconia (ICE Zirkon Translucent - 95H16; Zirkonzahn) and 5 titanium 
      (Titan 5 - 95H14; Zirkonzahn) frameworks were fabricated using the CAM milling
      unit (M1 Wet Heavy Metal Milling Unit; Zirkonzahn).The 1-screw test was applied
      by fixing the frameworks at the location of the maxillary left first molar
      abutment, and an industrial computed tomography (CT) scanner (XT H 225 - Basic
      Configuration; Nikon) was used to scan the framework-model complex to evaluate
      the passive fit of the frameworks on the master model. The scanned data were
      transported in standard tessellation language (STL) from Volume Graphics analysis
      software to PolyWorks analysis software by using the maximum-fit algorithm to fit
      scanned planes in order to mimic the mating surfaces in the best way. 3D virtual 
      assessment of the marginal fit was performed at the abutment-framework interface 
      at the maxillary right canine (gap 3) and right first molar (gap 4) abutments
      without prosthetic screws. The facial or buccal aspects of the teeth on
      frameworks were layered with corresponding porcelain (Initial Dental Ceramic
      System; GC) and CT-scanned again using the same protocol. Marginal fit
      measurements were made for 4 groups: titanium (Ti) (control), porcelain-layered
      titanium (Ti-P) (control), zirconia (Zir), and porcelain-layered zirconia
      (Zir-P). 3D discrepancy mean values were computed and calculated, and the results
      were analyzed with a repeated measures 3-way ANOVA using the maximum likelihood
      estimation method and Bonferroni adjustments for selected pairwise comparison
      t-tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The 3D fit was measured at gap 3 and gap 4.
      Statistically significant differences in mean 3D discrepancies were observed
      between Zir-P (175 mum) and Zir (89 mum) and between Zir-P and Ti-P (71 mum)
      (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Porcelain layering had a significant effect on the
      marginal fit of CAD-CAM-fabricated complete-arch implant-supported,
      screw-retained FDPs with partially sintered zirconia frameworks. 3D marginal
      discrepancy mean values for all groups were within clinically acceptable limits
      (<120 mum), except for the layered zirconia framework.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects, digital impression procedures can have on
      the three-dimensional fit of ceramic partial crowns in vitro. METHODS: An acrylic
      model of a mandibular first molar was prepared to receive a partial coverage
      all-ceramic crown (mesio-occlusal-distal inlay preparation with reduction of all 
      cusps and rounded shoulder finish line of buccal wall). Digital impressions were 
      taken using iTero (ITE), cara TRIOS (TRI), CEREC AC with Bluecam (CBC), and Lava 
      COS (COS) systems, before restorations were designed and machined from lithium
      disilicate blanks. Both the preparation and the restorations were digitised using
      an optical reference-scanner. Data were entered into quality inspection software,
      which superimposed the records (best-fit-algorithm), calculated fit-discrepancies
      for every pixel, and colour-coded the results to aid visualisation. Furthermore, 
      mean quadratic deviations (RMS) were computed and analysed statistically with a
      one-way ANOVA. Scheffe's procedure was applied for multiple comparisons (n=5,
      alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Mean marginal (internal) discrepancies were: ITE 90 (92)
      mum, TRI 128 (106) mum, CBC 146 (84) mum, and COS 109 (93) mum. Differences among
      impression systems were statistically significant at p<0.001 (p=0.039).
      Qualitatively, partial crowns were undersized especially around cusp tips or the 
      occluso-approximal isthmus. By contrast, potential high-spots could be detected
      along the preparation finishline and at central occlusal boxes. CONCLUSIONS:
      Marginal and internal fit of milled lithium disilicate partial crowns depended on
      the employed digital impression technique. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The
      investigated digital impression procedures demonstrated significant fit
      discrepancies. However, all fabricated restorations showed acceptable marginal
      and internal gap sizes, when considering clinically relevant thresholds reported 
      in the literature.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A consensus on the clinical performance of
      implant-supported removable partial dentures (ISRPDs) is lacking. PURPOSE: The
      purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical 
      performance of ISRPDs in terms of the implant survival rates, marginal bone loss,
      and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four
      electronic databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane
      Library) were independently searched by 2 reviewers for articles published up to 
      December 2020. A single-arm meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the implant
      survival rates and marginal bone loss by using the R program. The Cochrane
      collaboration tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias of randomized controlled
      trials (RCTs), and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for non-RCT studies. RESULTS:
      Sixteen studies were included, with a total of 334 participants and a mean age of
      58 years. The participants received a total of 581 dental implants, 475
      conventional and 106 mini-implants. All included studies reported implant
      survival rate above 90% (range: 92% to 100%). Meta-analysis indicated a high
      proportion of implant survival rates of 3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2% to
      5%) and a low mean raw score of marginal bone loss 0.98 mm (CI: 0.61 to 1.36 mm).
      Compared with conventional RPDs, improved patient quality of life and
      satisfaction were reported by studies that evaluated ISRPDs. RCT studies
      exhibited a low risk of bias for most domains, while most non-RCT studies were
      classified as good quality. CONCLUSIONS: ISRPDs exhibited high implant survival
      rates and acceptable bone loss with improvement in the quality of life and
      satisfaction of patients when compared with conventional RPDs. Therefore, they
      can be considered suitable for the rehabilitation of partially edentulous
      patients.

TI  - Internal fit of three-unit fixed dental prostheses produced by computer-aided

      assessed using the triple-scan protocol.
PG  - 66-73

AB  - Suboptimal adaptation of fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) can lead to technical and
      biological complications. It is unclear if the computer-aided
      design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technique improves adaptation of
      FDPs compared with FDPs made using the lost-wax and metal casting technique.
      Three-unit FDPs were manufactured by CAD/CAM based on digital impression of a
      typodont model. The FDPs were made from one of five materials: pre-sintered
      zirconium dioxide; hot isostatic pressed zirconium dioxide; lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic; milled cobalt-chromium; and laser-sintered cobalt-chromium. The
      FDPs made using the lost-wax and metal casting technique were used as reference. 
      The fit of the FDPs was analysed using the triple-scan method. The fit was
      evaluated for both single abutments and three-unit FDPs. The average cement space
      varied between 50 mum and 300 mum. Insignificant differences in internal fit were
      observed between the CAD/CAM-manufactured FDPs, and none of the FPDs had cement
      spaces that were statistically significantly different from those of the
      reference FDP. For all FDPs, the cement space at a marginal band 0.5-1.0 mm from 
      the preparation margin was less than 100 mum. The milled cobalt-chromium FDP had 
      the closest fit. The cement space of FDPs produced using the CAD/CAM technique
      was similar to that of FDPs produced using the conventional lost-wax and metal
      casting technique.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: No studies have evaluated the internal adaptation of
      pressed and milled ceramic crowns made from digital impressions. PURPOSE: The
      purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the internal fit of pressed and
      milled ceramic crowns made from digital and conventional impressions. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: Thirty polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impressions and 30 Lava COS
      impressions made of a prepared dentoform tooth (master die) were fabricated.
      Thirty crowns were pressed in lithium disilicate (IPS e.max Press), and 30 crowns
      were milled from lithium disilicate blocks (IPS e.max CAD) (15/impression
      technique) with the E4D scanner and milling engine. The master die and the
      intaglio of the crowns were digitized with a 3-dimensional laser coordinate
      measurement machine. The digital master die and intaglio of each crown were
      merged. The distance between the die and the intaglio surface of the crown was
      measured at 3 standardized points. One-way ANOVA was used for statistical
      analysis (alpha=.05). RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed that the internal gap
      obtained from the Lava/press group (0.211 mm, +/-SD 0.041) was significantly
      greater than that obtained from the other groups (P<.001), while no significant
      differences were found among PVS/press (0.111 mm +/-SD 0.047), PVS/CAD/CAM (0.116
      mm +/-SD 0.02), and Lava/CAD/CAM (0.145 mm +/-SD 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The
      combination of the digital impression and pressed crown produced the least
      accurate internal fit.

TI  - In Vitro Study of Comparative Evaluation of Marginal and Internal Fit between
      Heat-Pressed and CAD-CAM Monolithic Glass-Ceramic Restorations after Thermal
      Aging.

AB  - The accuracy of newly developed ceramic materials is still being studied.
      Marginal and internal adaptation are known factors that have an essential impact 
      on the long term success of dental restorations. The aim of this in vitro study
      was to evaluate the marginal and internal fit of heat-pressed and milled
      monolithic glass-ceramic restorations based on their ceramic type, processing
      technique, and in vitro thermocycling. Thirty-two crowns were studied and divided
      into four groups (n = 8), according to the ceramic material (feldspathic
      glass-ceramic (F) and zirconia reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (ZLS))
      and to their technological obtaining processes (milling (M) and heat-pressing
      (P)). A typodont preparation was scanned with a D2000 3D scanner to obtain
      identical 32 resin 3D-printed abutment teeth. Marginal and internal gaps were
      measured using the silicone replica technique under 40x magnification. The crowns
      were further cemented and thermally aged for 10,000 cycles After cementation and 
      thermocycling of the samples, marginal and internal gaps were assessed using
      micro-CT (micro-computed tomography)) analysis. Data were statistically analyzed 
      using statistical tests. Significant differences were found before and after
      cementation and thermocycling among the tested materials (p < 0.05). Related to
      technological processing, significant differences were seen in the marginal area 
      between FP and FM (p < 0.05) Significant differences were also found in the axial
      and occlusal areas between the ZLSP and ZLSM. Thermocycling and cementation did
      not have a significant effect on the tested materials (p < 0.05). The
      technological processes influenced the marginal and internal fit of the crowns in
      favor of the CAD/CAM (computer aided design/computer aided
      manufacturing)technologies. Thermal aging had little effect on marginal
      adaptability; it increased the values for all the tested samples in a small way, 
      but the values remained in their clinically acceptable range for all of the
      crowns.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Factors that may affect the marginal adaptation of
      computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorations
      include preparation design, impression technique, and CAD-CAM system. The
      influence of impression technique and preparation design on CAD-CAM partial
      coverage restorations has not been fully addressed. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 
      in vitro study was to investigate the influence of direct and indirect digital
      scanning techniques and 2 preparation designs on the marginal adaptation of
      CAD-CAM onlays. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two mesio-occlusal buccal onlay
      preparations with reduction of the mesiobuccal cusp were made: conventional
      preparation (CP) with a 1.2-mm modified shoulder margin and modified preparation 
      (MP) flat cuspal reduction without shoulder. Virtual models were generated from
      each preparation by using a digital scanner (BlueCam; Dentsply Sirona) from the
      plastic teeth (direct digital scan) or from the stone dies (indirect digital
      scan). Onlays were designed using a CAD-CAM system (CEREC 4.0; Dentsply Sirona), 
      and nanoceramic resin blocks (Lava Ultimate Restorative; 3M ESPE) were milled
      using the CEREC MCX milling machine. Marginal discrepancy was evaluated using an 
      optical stereomicroscope at x25 magnification in 18 locations distributed along
      the margins of the preparation. The data were analyzed by using 3-way ANOVA
      followed by the Tukey HSD test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: CP presented a statistically
      significant reduced average marginal adaptation (59 +/-50 mum) than did MP (69
      +/-58 mum) (P<.001). The Tukey HSD test showed the presence of a significantly
      larger marginal discrepancy in the mesial and buccal locations of MP when
      compared with CP. Regarding impression techniques, the buccal location presented 
      the smallest average marginal discrepancy in restorations fabricated with
      indirect impression when compared with direct impression (42 +/-33 mum and 60
      +/-39 mum) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that conventional
      preparation with a modified shoulder margin presented improved marginal
      adaptation compared with modified preparation with flat cuspal reduction. Direct 
      and indirect digital scanning techniques produced restorations within a
      clinically acceptable range; however, the indirect scanning technique resulted in
      the fabrication of restorations with superior marginal adaptation on the buccal
      location.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical results and technical complications with
      computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) zirconia,
      implant fixed complete dental prostheses (IFCDPs) after 2-4 years in function.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen consecutive edentulous patients (16 edentulous
      arches) were included in this study. Ten of the patients were women and four were
      men, with an average age of 58 years (range: 35-71). Ten mandibular and six
      maxillary arches were restored with porcelain fused to zirconia (PFZ) IFCDPs. Of 
      the 16 arches, 14 received one-piece and 2 received segmented two-piece IFCDPs,
      respectively. The mean clinical follow-up period was 3 years (range: 2-4). At the
      last recall appointment, biological and technical parameters of dental implant
      treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: The implant and prosthesis survival rate
      following prosthesis insertion was 100% up to 4-year follow-up. The prostheses in
      11 of the 16 restored arches were structurally sound, exhibited favorable soft
      tissue response, esthetics, and patient satisfaction. Five IFCDPs (31.25%) in
      four patients exhibited porcelain veneer chipping. Chipping was minor in three
      prostheses (three patients) and was addressed intraorally with polishing (one
      prosthesis) or composite resin (two prostheses). One patient with maxillary and
      mandibular zirconia IFCDP exhibited major porcelain chipping fractures which had 
      to be repaired in the laboratory. Function, esthetics, and patient satisfaction
      were not affected in three of the four fracture incidents. Median crestal bone
      loss was 0.1 mm (0.01-0.2 mm). The presence of parafunctional activity, the IFCDP
      as opposing dentition, and the absence of occlusal night guard were associated
      with all the incidents of ceramic chipping. CONCLUSION: CAD/CAM zirconia IFCDPs
      are viable prosthetic treatment after 2-4 years in function, but not without
      complications. The porcelain chipping/fracture was the most frequent technical
      complication, with a 31.25% chipping rate at the prosthesis level. Despite the
      technical complications, increased patient satisfaction was noted.

TI  - Effect of Fabrication Technique on the Marginal Discrepancy and Resistance of
      Lithium Disilicate Crowns: An In Vitro Study.
PG  - 1005-1010
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13014 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of fabrication technique on the marginal fit and 
      resistance of lithium disilicate crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve ivorine
      molars were prepared to receive lithium disilicate crowns. The preparations were 
      digitally recorded using an intraoral scanner, and the crowns were designed
      following the anatomy of an unprepared tooth using a design software. The
      designed crowns were fabricated using 3 techniques: (1) milling from lithium
      disilicate blocks using a 3-axis milling machine (3XM), (2) milling from lithium 
      disilicate blocks using a 5-axis milling machine (5XM), and (3) milling from
      resin-wax billet using a 5-axis milling machine, followed by heat-pressing the
      pattern into lithium disilicate (5XWP). For the control group, the wax patterns
      were fabricated by one lab technician, and the crowns were fabricated by
      heat-pressing the pattern into lithium disilicate (CWP). After sintering, the
      crowns were secured on their associated preparations using an elastomeric
      material. The marginal gap of each crown was then measured at 14 defined
      locations through analyses of 20x images captured with a stereomicroscope. The
      marginal integrity and resistance to rotation of each crown were assessed by 2
      calibrated practitioners. Differences in outcomes by fabrication technique were
      assessed using Wilcoxon, Kruskal Wallis, and Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate
      (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: Crowns fabricated using digital workflows (3XM, 5XM,
      5XWP) had significantly smaller mean marginal gaps compared to the CWP group (p =
      0.0001, p = 0.0002, p = 0.0001, respectively); however, 3XM group was the only
      group to exhibit significantly better marginal integrity than the CWP group (p = 
      0.0004). No significant difference (p = 0.6004) in the resistance to rotation of 
      crowns was observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of fabrication technique 
      and instrument may impact the marginal discrepancy of lithium disilicate crowns; 
      however, all fabrication techniques analyzed produced crowns with acceptable
      marginal discrepancies.

TI  - Should the restoration of adjacent implants be splinted or nonsplinted? A
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 41-51

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The decision to splint or to restore independently
      generally occurs during the planning stage, when the advantages and disadvantages
      of each clinical situation are considered based on the proposed treatment.
      However, clinical evidence to help clinicians make this decision is lacking.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess
      the marginal bone loss, implant survival rate, and prosthetic complications of
      splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study
      was designed according to the Cochrane criteria for elaborating a systematic
      review and meta-analysis and adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
      Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Also, this review was registered at
      the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)
      (CRD42017080162). An electronic search in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library,
      and Scopus databases was conducted up to November 2017. A specific clinical
      question was structured according to the population, intervention, comparison,
      outcome (PICO) approach. The addressed focused question was ""Should the
      restoration of adjacent implants be splinted or nonsplinted?"" The meta-analysis
      was based on the Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance methods to assess the
      marginal bone loss, implant survival, and prosthetic complications of splinted
      and nonsplinted implant restorations. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were selected for
      qualitative and quantitative analyses. A total of 4215 implants were placed in
      2185 patients (splinted, 2768; nonsplinted, 1447); the mean follow-up was 87.8
      months (range=12-264 months). Quantitative analysis found no significant
      differences between splinted and nonsplinted restorations for marginal bone loss.
      The assessed studies reported that 75 implants failed (3.4%), of which 24 were
      splinted (99.1% of survival rate) and 51 were nonsplinted (96.5% of survival
      rate). Quantitative analysis of all studies showed statistically significant
      higher survival rates for splinted restorations than for nonsplinted
      restorations. Ceramic chipping, screw loosening, abutment screw breakage, and
      soft tissue inflammation were reported in the selected studies. The quantitative 
      analysis found no statistically significant difference in the prosthetic
      complications of splinted and nonsplinted restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Within the
      limitations of this systematic review and meta-analysis, it was concluded that
      there was no difference in the marginal bone loss and prosthetic complications of
      splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations; this is especially true for
      restorations in the posterior region. However, splinted restorations were
      associated with decreased implant failure.

TI  - Fracture Resistance of CAD/CAM-Fabricated Lithium Disilicate MOD Inlays and
      Onlays with Various Cavity Preparation Designs.
PG  - e524-e529
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12787 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the fracture resistance of premolars restored with CAD/CAM
      lithium disilicate mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) inlays and onlays of different
      cavity designs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two widths of occlusal isthmus (75%, 100% 
      of intercuspal distance) and three designs of cuspal coverage (none, palatal,
      complete) were used for the preparation of MOD inlays and onlays in the extracted
      maxillary premolars. Sixty lithium disilicate restorations were milled and bonded
      into the cavities. After 24 hours of water storage, the specimens were loaded
      until fracture, and the fracture loads (N) were measured. Any evidence of cracks 
      and fractures on the tested specimens were examined to classify failure patterns.
      RESULTS: Mean fracture load values for the tested groups were as follows: 664.4
      +/- 214.7 N (group A), 659.3 +/- 391.2 N (B), 681.9 +/- 258.1 N (C), 938.1 +/-
      862.0 N (D), 841.7 +/- 375.4 N (E), and 994.2 +/- 486.3 N (F). The width of
      occlusal isthmus did not significantly affect the fracture loads among all the
      groups. Within groups with identical isthmus width, the fracture loads showed no 
      significant difference depending on the designs of cuspal coverage. The majority 
      of specimens showed either type III or IV fracture mode. CONCLUSIONS: Within
      limitations of this study, the bonded restorations of premolars with
      CAD/CAM-generated lithium disilicate were reliable, regardless of cavity
      preparation design.

TI  - Accuracy of marginal fit and axial wall contour for lithium disilicate crowns
      fabricated using three digital workflows.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Comparative assessment of the effectiveness of
      computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technologies
      used to fabricate complete-coverage restorations is needed. A quantitative
      assessment requires precise documentation of the marginal adaptation and external
      surface contour of fabricated restorations. Limited information is currently
      available regarding the effects of milling mode on marginal adaptation and
      reproduction of the external surface contour for CAD-CAM-fabricated restorations.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the outcomes for 3
      different digital workflows on the marginal gap and the external surface contour 
      reproducibility of CAD-CAM-fabricated lithium disilicate complete-coverage
      restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve Ivorine molars were prepared to
      receive lithium disilicate crowns. The preparations were digitally recorded using
      2 intraoral scanners (TRIOS 3; 3Shape A/S and Planmeca PlanScan; E4D
      Technologies), and the restorations were designed using their associated design
      software with reference to the anatomy of an unprepared tooth. The designed
      restorations were then manufactured from lithium disilicate blocks using a 3-axis
      milling machine. Twelve restorations were manufactured using the detailed mode
      (Planmeca PlanScan detailed mode [PPD-D]), and 12 using the standard mode for the
      Planmeca system (Planmeca PlanScan standard mode [PPD-S]). Restorations from the 
      3Shape system were fabricated using the detailed mode (TRIOS 3Shape detailed mode
      [T3S-D]). The restorations were secured on their associated preparation with an
      elastomeric material. The marginal gap of each restoration was then measured in
      the ImageJ software using images captured by a stereo microscope at x20
      magnification. External surface reproducibility was evaluated by measuring
      undercut at 4-line angles using a dental surveyor. Differences in the marginal
      gaps of restorations fabricated using the 3 different workflows were compared by 
      Brown-Forsythe robust ANOVA, followed by a post hoc test (alpha=.05). Chi-square 
      analysis (alpha=.05) was used to evaluate differences in the contours of the
      external surface of the restorations, resistance form, and marginal integrity
      produced using the 3 workflows. RESULTS: The mean marginal gap for restorations
      fabricated using the T3S-D workflow was 60 mum, a distance significantly lower
      (P<.05) than that of PPD-D and PPD-S workflows, which yielded a marginal gap of
      95 mum for the detailed mode and 124 mum for the standard mode of milling.
      Restorations fabricated using PPD-D and PPD-S workflows produced a significantly 
      more reproducible external surface contour than those fabricated using the T3S-D 
      workflow. CONCLUSIONS: Restorations fabricated using the T3S-D workflow produced 
      the smallest marginal gap. However, reproducibility of the external surface
      contour for this workflow was the worst of the three workflows analyzed.

TI  - Comparison of marginal adaptation and internal fit of monolithic lithium
      disilicate crowns produced by 4 different CAD/CAM systems.
PG  - 2029-2036
LID - 10.1007/s00784-020-03511-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the marginal adaptation and internal space of crowns
      produced by 4 CAD/CAM systems using microcomputed tomography (muCT) and replica
      technique (RT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Monolithic lithium disilicate crowns were 
      milled (Ceramill, Cerec, EDG, and Zirkonzahn) (n = 10). The cement film obtained 
      with low viscosity silicone was scanned by the muCT system and captured by a
      stereomicroscope, according to RT. Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test were
      used for statistical analysis (alpha = 0.05). A uniformity index (UI) was
      idealized to describe the distribution of crowns' internal space and submitted to
      the Kruskal-Wallis and Tukey's test (alpha = 0.05). The correlation between muCT 
      and RT was performed by Pearson's Correlation Coeficient (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS:
      Marginal adaptation and internal space were statistically significant different
      between the experimental groups for the muCT and RT (p < 0.05). The medians of
      the 4 systems tested were within clinically acceptable range and the mean (+/-
      SD) highest marginal discrepancy was recorded in the Ceramill group at 133.0 +/- 
      71.5 mum (muCT) and 90.6 +/- 38.5 mum (RT). For internal fit, the UI disclosed a 
      better distribution of the internal space for the Zirkonzahn group (p < 0.001).
      There was a strong correlation between the methods (p = 0.01 and r = 0.69).
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Because of the variability of the CAD/CAM systems available, 
      evaluating their accuracy is of clinical interest. The 4 systems are capable to
      produce restorations adaptated within clinically appropriate levels. The muCT and
      RT are efficient adaptation methodologies.

AB  - PurposeTo evaluate the influence of fabrication method and finish line design on 
      marginal and internal fit of full-coverage interim restorations. MethodsFour
      typodont models of maxillary central-incisor were prepared for full-coverage
      restorations. Four groups were defined; knife-edge (KE), chamfer (C),
      rounded-shoulder (RS), rounded-shoulder with bevel (RSB). All preparations were
      digitally scanned. A total of 80 restorations were fabricated; 20 per group
      (SLA/3D-printed n=10, milled n=10). All restorations were positioned on the
      master die and scanned using micro-computed tomography. The mean gaps were
      measured digitally (ImageJ). The results were compared using MANOVA (alpha=.05). 
      ResultsInternal and marginal gaps were significantly influenced by fabrication
      method (P=.000) and finish-line design (P=.000). 3D-Printed restorations showed
      statistically significant lower mean gap compared to milled restorations at all
      points (P=.000). The mean internal gap for 3D-printed restorations were 66, 149, 
      130, 95mum and for milled restorations were 89, 177, 185, 154mum for KE, C, RS,
      RSB respectively. The mean absolute marginal discrepancy in 3D-printed
      restorations were (30, 41, 30, 28mum) and in milled restorations were (56, 54,
      52, 38mum) for KE, C, RS, RSB respectively. ConclusionsThe fabrication methods
      showed more of an influence on the fit compared to the effect of the finish-line 
      design in both milled and printed restorations. SLA-printed interim restorations 
      exhibit lower marginal and internal gap than milled restorations. Nonetheless,
      for both techniques, all values were within the reported values for CAD/CAM
      restorations. Significance3D-printing can offer an alternative fabrication method
      comparable to those of milled restorations.

TI  - An in vitro comparison of the marginal and internal adaptation of ultrathin
      occlusal veneers made of 3D-printed zirconia, milled zirconia, and heat-pressed
      lithium disilicate.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Whether additively produced zirconia could overcome
      problems with conventional computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacture
      (CAD-CAM) such as milling inaccuracies and provide accurate occlusal veneers is
      unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the marginal 
      and internal fit of 3D-printed zirconia occlusal veneers with CAD-CAM-fabricated 
      zirconia or heat-pressed lithium disilicate ceramic (LS2) restorations on molars.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The occlusal enamel in 60 extracted human molars was
      removed, with the preparation extending into dentin. Occlusal veneers at a
      thickness of 0.5 mm were designed and manufactured according to their group
      allocation: 3DP, 3D-printed zirconia; CAM, milled zirconia; and HPR, heat-pressed
      LS2. The prepared teeth and restorations were scanned and superimposed, and the
      marginal and internal adaptation were measured 2- and 3-dimensionally; the
      production accuracy (trueness) was also measured. The comparisons of the group
      medians were performed with nonparametric methods and a pairwise group comparison
      (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Three-dimensionally printed zirconia revealed median
      outcomes of 95 mum (margin), 252 mum (cusp), 305 mum (fossa), and 184 mum (3D
      internal adaptation). CAM showed median values of 65 mum (margin), 128 mum
      (cusp), 203 mum (fossa), and 120 mum (3D internal adaptation). The respective
      values for the group HPR were 118 mum (margin), 251 mum (cusp), 409 mum (fossa), 
      and 180 mum (3D internal adaptation). Significant differences (P<.001) between
      CAM and 3DP (cusp, fossa, 3D internal adaptation) and between CAM and HPR (all
      regions) were found, with the former group showing higher accuracies. The
      trueness showed median discrepancies of 26 mum (3DP), 13 mum (CAM), and 29 mum
      (HPR) with significant differences (P<.001) for the comparisons 3DP-CAM and
      CAM-HPR. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensionally printed zirconia occlusal veneers
      produced by means of lithography-based ceramic manufacturing exhibit a marginal
      adaptation (95 mum) and a production accuracy (26 mum) similar to those of
      conventional methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure and compare the size of the cement gap of wax and polymer 
      copings and final glass-ceramic crowns, produced from conventional and digital
      workflows, one additive and one subtractive. METHODS: Thirty wax copings were
      made by conventional manual layering technique and modeling wax on stone models
      with spacer varnish simulating a cement spacer. The wax copings were embedded and
      press-cast in lithium disilicate glass ceramic. Thirty wax copings were produced 
      by milling from a wax blank, i.e. subtractive manufacturing, and thirty polymer
      burn-out copings were produced by stereolithography, i.e. additive manufacturing.
      These copings were embedded and press-cast in lithium disilicate glass ceramic in
      the same manner as the conventional group. The fit of the wax/polymer copings and
      subsequent crowns was checked using an impression replica method. Mean values for
      cement gap for marginal, axial, and occlusal areas were calculated and
      differences were analyzed using Student's t-test. RESULTS: There were significant
      differences in mean values for accuracy/production tolerance among different
      manufacturing techniques for both production stages: wax and polymer copings and 
      final pressed glass-ceramic crowns. In general, crowns produced from a digital
      additive workflow showed smaller mean cement gaps than crowns produced from a
      conventional workflow or a digital subtractive workflow. Additive polymer copings
      showed significantly smaller cement gaps than milled wax copings (p</=.001) and
      conventional wax copings (p</=.001) in the axial area. In the occlusal area, both
      additive polymer copings and conventional wax copings showed significantly
      smaller cement gaps than milled wax copings (p=.002 and p</=.001 respectively).
      Crowns produced from conventional manual build-up wax copings showed
      significantly larger mean cement gaps than crowns produced from milled wax and
      additively manufactured polymer copings in the marginal and axial areas
      (p</=.001). Among the crowns with smaller cement gaps, crowns produced from
      additively manufactured polymer copings showed significantly smaller mean cement 
      gaps than crowns produced from milled wax in the marginal and axial areas
      (p</=.001). In the occlusal areas, the differences in mean cement gaps were only 
      statistically significant between crowns produced from conventional manual
      build-up wax copings and crowns produced from milled wax where the latter ones
      showed smaller mean cement gaps (p=.025). SIGNIFICANCE: The present study
      suggests that an additive manufacturing technique produces smaller mean cement
      gaps in glass-ceramic crowns than a conventional or subtractive manufacturing
      technique.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The load-bearing capacity of ultra-thin occlusal veneers made of
      3D-printed zirconia were compared to the ones obtained by fabricating these
      reconstructions by CAD/CAM milling zirconia or heat-pressing lithium-disilicate. 
      METHODS: On 60 extracted human molars, the occlusal enamel was removed and
      extended into dentin. Occlusal veneers of 0.5 mm thickness were digitally
      designed. The specimens were divided into 3 groups (n = 20 each) differing in the
      restorative material and the fabrication technique of the occlusal veneer. (1)
      3DP: 3D-printed zirconia (Lithoz); (2): CAM: milled zirconia (Ceramill Zolid FX);
      (3) HPR: heat-pressed lithium disilicate (IPS e.max Press). After conditioning
      procedures, the restorations were adhesively bonded onto the conditioned tooth.
      Thereafter, all specimens were aged in a chewing simulator by exposure to cyclic 
      fatigue and temperature variations. Subsequently the specimens were statically
      loaded and the load which was necessary to decrease the maximum load by 20% and
      initiate a crack (Finitial) and the load which was needed to fracture the
      specimen (Fmax) were measured. Differences between the groups were compared
      applying the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test (WMW: p 
      < 0.05). RESULTS: The median Finitial values for the groups 3DP, CAM and HPR were
      1'650 N, 1'250 N and 500 N. The differences between all three groups were
      statistically significant (KW: p < 0.0001). The median Fmax values amounted to
      2'026 N for the group 3DP, 1'500 N for the group CAM and 1'555 N for the group
      HPR. Significant differences were found between 3DP and CAM (WMW: p = 0.0238).
      SIGNIFICANCE: Regarding their load-bearing capacity, 3D-printed or milled
      zirconia as well as heat-pressed lithium disilicate can be recommended as
      restorative material for ultra-thin occlusal veneers to prosthetically compensate
      for occlusal tooth wear. Despite statistically significant differences between
      the restoration materials, all load-bearing capacities exceeded the clinically
      expected normal bite forces.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the fit of ceramic inlays manufactured using a recently 
      introduced CAD/CAM-system (Decim) and of two types of laboratory-made
      heat-pressed ceramics (IPS Empress and Opc). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracted
      human premolars were prepared to receive mesio-occlusodistal (MOD) ceramic
      inlays, for which 10 Denzir, 10 IPS Empress, and 10 Opc were fabricated. The
      Denzir restorations were produced by the manufacturer of the CAD/CAM-system, and 
      the IPS Empress and Opc by student dental technicians. Before luting the internal
      fit on the diestone models and on the premolars was determined using replicas.
      After luting on the premolars with a resin composite the marginal and internal
      fit were measured. The values were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and
      Scheffe's test at a significance level of p<0.05. RESULTS: Before luting there
      were no significant differences (p>0.05) in the internal gap width between the
      three systems studied when placed on their matching diestone models. When placed 
      on the premolars a significant difference (p<0.01) in the internal fit was seen
      between Empress and Opc before luting, whereas there were no significant
      differences (p>0.05) between Empress and Denzir and between Opc and Denzir.
      Between the diestone models and the premolars there were significant differences 
      (p<0.01) in the internal fit, except for IPS Empress. After luting there were no 
      significant differences (p>0.05) between IPS Empress and Denzir, whereas the
      marginal gap width was significantly wider (p<0.001) for Opc than for IPS Empress
      and Denzir. The internal fit was significantly (p<0.001) wider for Opc than for
      IPS Empress, whereas there were no significant differences (p>0.05) between IPS
      Empress and Denzir or between Opc and Denzir. CONCLUSION: After luting there were
      only slight differences in the fit between the restorations fabricated using the 
      three different manufacturing techniques and ceramics. Therefore, long-term
      follow-up studies are needed to assess the clinical significance of the slight
      differences between the three systems.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report assessments of four systematic reviews (SRs) on (i)
      clinical outcomes of all-ceramic implant-supported crowns (iSCs), (ii) production
      time, effectiveness, and costs of computer-assisted manufacturing (CAM), (iii)
      computer-assisted implant planning and surgery (CAIPS) time and costs, and (iv)
      patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: An author group 
      consisting of experienced clinicians and content experts discussed and evaluated 
      the SRs and formulated consensus on the main findings, statements, clinical
      recommendations, and need for future research. RESULTS: All four SRs were
      conducted and reported according to PRISMA and detailed comprehensive search
      strategies in at least three bibliometric databases and hand searching. The
      search strategies were deemed reproducible. Variation was noted regarding
      language restrictions and inclusion of grey literature, but the search
      comprehensiveness appeared persuasive. The SRs included bias risk assessments of 
      the primary studies, and their study methodology impacted the interpretations of 
      the extracted data. CONCLUSIONS: (i) There is limited evidence (49 NRCT) showing 
      that veneered and monolithic all-ceramic iSCs have excellent outcomes observed up
      to 3 years. (ii) There is no evidence evaluating production time and
      effectiveness comparing subtractive and additive CAM of implant models, abutments
      and crowns. (iii) There is limited evidence (4 RCT) that CAIPS involves more time
      and costs when considering the entire workflow and for diagnostics,
      manufacturing, and insertion of the restoration. Time seems to be the decisive
      factor for higher costs. (iv) Patients' comfort increases when optical compared
      to conventional impressions are used for fabricating iSCs and short-span FPDs (2 
      RCT, 5 NRCT).

TI  - Evaluation of the clinical performance of dentures manufactured by computer-aided
      technology and conventional techniques: A systematic review.

LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.06.029 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The introduction of computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology for complete denture
      fabrication may have improved clinical outcomes compared with conventional
      techniques. However, systematic reviews comparing these techniques are lacking.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to identify, compare, and
      synthesize the outcomes of published clinical studies related to complete denture
      fabrication, with respect to the differences between CAD-CAM technology and
      conventional techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of studies 
      published up to March 16, 2020, was conducted by using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of
      Science, Cochrane Library, SciELO, and Embase databases according to the
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
      statement criteria and was registered in the International Prospective Register
      of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO ID 42020202614). The population, intervention,
      comparison, and outcome (PICO) question was: Do CAD-CAM complete dentures have a 
      similar functional performance to those fabricated by conventional techniques?
      The quality of publications was appraised by using the Critical Appraisal Skills 
      Program (CASP) checklists. RESULTS: Of the 1232 titles, 6 articles were selected.
      The studies reported better retention of digitally manufactured complete dentures
      without denture adhesives than that of conventional complete dentures with or
      without denture adhesives. Other studies reported that dentures manufactured with
      digital systems were better adapted to tissue surfaces, required less clinical
      time, were lower in cost, and provided better experience and satisfaction to
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of CAD-CAM planning and manufacturing
      through clinical studies is ongoing. However, preliminary results indicate better
      clinical performance and lower overall costs of digital complete dentures than
      conventional dentures.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Subtractive and additive computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) wax pattern processing are 2 methods of
      fabricating a pressed ceramic crown. Whether a subtractive milled wax pattern or 
      a pattern from the micro-stereolithography additive process produces lithium
      disilicate crowns with better marginal and internal fi t is unclear. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Ten silicone impressions were made for a prepared canine tooth. Each
      die received 2 lithium disilicate (IPS e.max) copings, 1 from milled wax blocks
      and 1 from additive wax. The replica technique was used to measure the fit by
      scanning electron microscopy at x80 magnification. Collected data were analyzed
      using the paired Student t test for the marginal and internal fit. For the
      occlusal fit, the difference in scores did not follow a normal distribution, and 
      the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The mean marginal,
      axial, and occlusal fit showed no significant differences when the 2 CAD-CAM
      manufacturing processes were compared (P>.05). For the marginal fit, the mean
      (+/-SD) values were 105.1 mum +/-39.6 with the milled process and 126.2 mum
      +/-25.2 for the additive process. The mean values were 98.1 mum +/-26.1 for the
      axial fit in the milled process and 106.8 mum +/-21.2 in the additive process.
      For the occlusal fit, median values (interquartile interval) were 199.0 mum
      (141.5 to 269.9) for subtractive manufacturing and 257.2 mum (171.6 to 266.0) for
      micro-SLA manufacturing. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was found between
      the fit of the 2 techniques. The mean values of axial and occlusal median values 
      were 10 and 5 to 6 times greater than machine's nominal values.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A novel three-dimensional scanning technique was used to investigate 
      the effects a one-step and a two-step impression methods can have on the
      three-dimensional fit of ceramic partial crowns. METHODS: An acrylic model of a
      mandibular first molar was prepared to receive a partial coverage all-ceramic
      crown (mesio-occlusal-distal inlay preparation with reduction of all cusps and
      rounded shoulder finish line of buccal wall). Type IV plaster replicates were
      cast based on one-step single viscosity (OS/SV), one-step dual viscosity (OS/DV),
      and two-step dual viscosity (TS/DV) impressions. Five partial crowns were
      fabricated per impression method using hot-pressed lithium disilicate ceramics.
      Then, preparation and restorations were digitized using a non-contact,
      white-light scanner featuring self-calibrating optics (overall measurement
      uncertainty of <5mum). Data were entered into quality inspection software which
      superimposed the records (best-fit-algorithm), calculated fit-discrepancies for
      every pixel, and colour-coded the results to aid visualization. Furthermore, mean
      quadratic deviations (RMS) were computed and analyzed statistically with a 1-way 
      ANOVA. Scheffe's procedure was applied for multiple comparisons (alpha=0.05).
      RESULTS: Mean RMS-values for marginal (internal) surfaces were: OS/SV 70 (20)mum,
      OS/DV 78 (34)mum, and TS/DV 107 (52)mum. Differences among impression techniques 
      were statistically significant at p=0.006 (0.001). Qualitatively, occlusal ridges
      and preparation finish lines were over contoured, whereas inner occlusal boxes
      and the proximal-occlusal isthmus were under contoured. CONCLUSIONS: OS/SV and
      OS/DV impressions resulted in statistically significantly smaller marginal and
      internal discrepancies than the two-step technique. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
      Marginal and internal fit of hot-pressed lithium disilicate partial crowns
      depended on the employed impression technique. One-step impressions are preferred
      over two-step techniques in many day-to-day clinical situations, especially for
      the fabrication of partial coverage crown restorations.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Demand is increasing for polyetheretherketone (PEEK) as a
      fixed dental prosthesis core material. However, information is lacking about how 
      the precision of these restorations is affected by the fabrication procedures.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of
      different fabrication techniques on the marginal precision of PEEK single-crown
      copings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A stainless-steel master die was designed to
      simulate a prepared mandibular second molar to receive ceramic crowns. Thirty
      PEEK copings were fabricated and divided into 3 groups (n=10) according to the
      fabrication technique: milled from a prefabricated PEEK blank by using a
      computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) system (PC);
      pressed from prefabricated PEEK pellets (PP); and pressed from PEEK granules
      (PG); in addition, 3-mol yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal
      (3Y-TZP) copings (n=10) were produced by using the same CAD-CAM system and served
      as a control. Marginal precision measurements (in mum) were recorded at 4
      reference points on each coping by using a digital microscope. The data obtained 
      were statistically analyzed by using 1-way ANOVA and the pair-wise Tukey (HSD)
      test to study the difference between group mean values (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The 
      overall mean +/-standard deviation marginal gap at the marginal opening for the
      copings was 78 +/-10 mum for PEEK granules copings, 72 +/-9 mum for PEEK pellet
      copings, 45 +/-6 mum for PEEK CAD-CAM copings, and 43 +/-1 mum for the 3Y-TZP
      CAD-CAM control. A statistically significant difference was found between the
      milled and pressed copings as indicated by the ANOVA test (P<.001). The pair-wise
      Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test showed a nonsignificant
      difference (P>.05) between milled 3Y-TZP and milled PEEK copings; moreover, no
      significant difference was observed between the PEEK copings pressed from pellets
      or granules (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: The marginal precision of PEEK
      CAD-CAM-fabricated copings showed significantly lower mean marginal gap values
      than PEEK pressed copings. The marginal gap mean values recorded were all within 
      a clinically acceptable range (120 mum).

TI  - Five-year clinical performance of monolithic and partially veneered zirconia
      single crowns-a prospective observational study.
LID - 10.2186/jpr.JPR_D_21_00024 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the medium-term 
      clinical performance and esthetics of monolithic and partially (i.e., facially)
      veneered zirconia single crowns (MZ-SC and PZ-SC, respectively). METHODS: Between
      September 2011 and June 2013, 68 participants received 90 MZ-SC and 72 PZ-SC.
      Clinical study documentation was performed at crown cementation (baseline), at
      6-month follow-up, and then yearly thereafter using standardized report forms.
      Three participants with four MZ-SC dropped out during clinical follow-up. Thus,
      65 participants (n = 31, 47.7% men) fitted with 158 restorations (86 MZ-SC, 72
      PZ-SC) were evaluated. The mean observation period of the restorations was 5.8
      +/-2.5 years; 6.3 +/-2.2 for MZ-SC and 5.2 +/-2.6 for PZ-SC. RESULTS: The 5-year 
      rate of complication-free survival (success) was 87.0% for MZ-SC and 95.8% for
      PZ-SC (log-rank test, p = 0.026). The 5-year failure-free survival rate was 93.1%
      for MZ-SC and 96.2% for PZ-SC (log-rank test, p = 0.111), and the 5-year ceramic 
      fracture-free survival rate was 100% for MZ-SC and 98.6% for PZ-SC (log-rank
      test, p = 0.274). Crowns of both designs were awarded excellent scores for
      esthetics by participants and dentists. CONCLUSIONS: Monolithic and partially
      veneered zirconia crowns can be used clinically with high medium-term survival
      and success and uncompromised esthetic results.

LID - 10.11607/ijp.6443 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the marginal and internal gap values of different types of
      ceramic crowns fabricated based on digital and conventional impression methods.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten noncarious extracted human teeth were prepared, and 60
      restorations were made using six different impression and fabrication methods.
      Silicone replicas were obtained for marginal and internal gap evaluation.
      Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests
      (P < .05). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found among
      various impression and fabrication methods. The smallest gap value was shown by
      the monolithic zirconia indirect digital scanning group (31.13 mum), and the
      largest for the lithium disilicate indirect digital scanning group (90.09 mum).
      CONCLUSION: The marginal and internal gap values of the restorations in the
      present study were 31.13 to 90.09 mum. The marginal and internal discrepancies of
      the tested materials were considered clinically acceptable.

AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate internal and marginal adaptation of
      lithium disilicate partial crowns fabricated using IPS e.max Press and IPS e.max 
      CAD systems. Forty maxillary first molars were divided into two groups. The
      margins were located above the cementoenamel junction mesially and below it
      distally. The adaptation of the restoration was evaluated by means of the
      silicone replica technique. The lowest marginal discrepancy was measured between 
      the preparation margin on the enamel and the IPS e.max Press specimens; the
      highest discrepancy was observed on the occlusal surface of the IPS e.max CAD
      specimens. Both systems tested demonstrated acceptable marginal discrepancies in 
      vitro.

LID - 10.1155/2013/210763 [doi]
AB  - Clinical success of endodontically treated posterior teeth is determined by the
      postendodontic restoration. Several options have been proposed to restore
      endodontically treated teeth. Endocrowns represent a conservative and esthetic
      restorative alternative to full coverage crowns. The preparation consists of a
      circular equigingival butt-joint margin and central retention cavity into the
      entire pulp chamber constructing both the crown and the core as a single unit.
      The case reports discussed here are moderately damaged endodontically treated
      molars restored using all ceramic endocrowns fabricated using two different
      systems, namely, CAD/CAM and pressed ceramic.

TI  - Effect of Composite Core Materials on Fracture Resistance of Endodontically
      Treated Teeth: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of In Vitro Studies.
LID - 2251 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym13142251 [doi]
AB  - Various material properties are involved in the success of endodontically treated
      restorations. At present, restorative composites are commonly employed as core
      build-up materials. This study aimed to systematically review the literature to
      assess the effect of using composite core materials on the in vitro fracture of
      endodontically treated teeth. Two different reviewers screened the literature, up
      to June 2021, in five distinct electronic databases: PubMed (MedLine), Scopus,
      Scielo, ISI Web of Science, and EMBASE. Only in vitro studies reporting the
      effect of the use of composite core materials on the fracture resistance of
      endodontically treated teeth were included. A meta-analysis was carried out using
      a software program (Review Manager v5.4.1; The Cochrane Collaboration,
      Copenhagen, Denmark). The risk of bias in each study was assessed following the
      parameters of another systematic review. A total of 5016 relevant papers were
      retrieved from all databases. After assessing the title and abstract, five
      publications remained for qualitative analysis. From these, only three studies
      remained for meta-analysis. The fracture strength of endodontically treated teeth
      where a core build-up composite was used was statistically significantly higher
      than the control (p = 0.04). Most of the analyses showed a high heterogenicity.
      The in vitro evidence suggests that the composite core build-up with higher
      filler content tended to improve the fracture resistance of the endodontically
      treated teeth, in comparison with conventional composite resins. This research
      received no external funding. Considering that this systematic review was only
      carried out on in vitro papers, registration was not performed. Furthermore,
      there were no identified clinical studies assessing core build-up materials;
      therefore, more well-designed research on these materials is needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Machined restorations have been investigated for their preciseness
      before, while detailed information on the milling-step itself are lacking.
      Therefore, the aim of this laboratory study was to quantify the effect of a novel
      milling-procedure on the marginal and internal fit of ceramic restorations.
      METHODS: An acrylic model of a lower left first molar was prepared to receive a
      ceramic partial crown and was duplicated by one step dual viscosity impressions. 
      Gypsum casts were formed and laser-scanned to realize virtual datasets, before
      restorations were designed, exported (PRE) and machined from lithium disilicate
      blanks. Crowns were digitized by a structure-light-scanner to obtain
      post-milling-data (POST). PRE and POST were virtually superimposed on the
      reference tooth and subjected to computer-aided-inspection. Visual
      fit-discrepancies were displayed with colors, while root mean square deviations
      (RMSD) and degrees of similarity (DS) were computed and analysed by t-tests for
      paired samples (n=5, alpha=0.05). RESULTS: The milling procedure resulted in a
      small increase of the marginal and internal fit discrepancies (RMSD mean: 3mum
      and 6mum, respectively). RMSD differences were not statistically significant
      (p=0.495 and p=0.160 for marginal and internal fit, respectively). These results 
      were supported by the DS data. SIGNIFICANCE: The products of digital dental
      workflows are prone to imprecisions. However, the present findings suggest that
      differences between computer-aided designed and actually milled restorations are 
      small, especially when compared to typical fit discrepancies observed clinically.
      Imprecisions introduced by digital design or production processes are small.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD-CAM) technology and the improved translucency of recently developed
      high-strength monolithic zirconia could make them clinically acceptable for
      veneers if bonding to zirconia was as predictable as to glass-ceramics. Few
      studies have compared how resin cements behave between glass-ceramic and zirconia
      veneers before and after polymerization. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro
      study was to evaluate the volumetric polymerization shrinkage of resin cement,
      marginal discrepancy, and cement thickness before and after polymerization for
      glass-ceramic and zirconia veneers with light-polymerizing resin cement. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: Ten lithium disilicate veneers and 10 zirconia veneers were
      fabricated with a CAD-CAM workflow on extracted human maxillary anterior teeth
      with intact enamel surfaces. Zirconia veneers were treated with airborne-particle
      abrasion, and lithium disilicate veneers were etched with 5% hydrofluoric acid.
      All specimens were treated with ceramic primer and cemented with a
      light-polymerized resin cement. All specimens were scanned before and after resin
      cement polymerization by microcomputed tomography. The data were processed by the
      Amira software program to compare polymerization volumetric shrinkage, cement
      thickness, and marginal discrepancy. The data were compared by using a t test and
      analysis of variance (alpha=.05). Two bonded veneers were loaded in a mastication
      simulator for 400 000 cycles to investigate the effect of cyclic fatigue loading.
      RESULTS: Mean volumetric polymerization shrinkage was 4.2 +/-0.8% for the lithium
      disilicate group and 6.4 +/-3.5% for the zirconia group. No significant
      difference was found for volumetric shrinkage between materials (P=.132). The
      mean +/-standard deviations of the marginal discrepancies before and after
      polymerization were 178 +/-41 mum and 158 +/-37 mum for lithium disilicate and
      115 +/-33 mum and 107 +/-32 mum for zirconia. A smaller marginal discrepancy was 
      found for both materials after polymerization (P=.011) and for zirconia compared 
      with lithium disilicate (P=.004). The mean +/-standard deviation cement thickness
      values before and after polymerization were 157 +/-27 mum and 147 +/-27 mum for
      lithium disilicate and 162 +/-53 mum and 147 +/-52 mum for zirconia. Smaller
      cement thickness was found after polymerization (P<.001), whereas no significant 
      difference was found in cement thickness between materials (P=.144). No changes
      were noted in marginal discrepancy and cement thickness as a result of the
      fatigue loading. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in the volumetric polymerization
      shrinkage of cement between lithium disilicate and zirconia veneers was not
      statistically significant. Polymerization shrinkage resulted in smaller marginal 
      discrepancy and cement thickness for both veneer materials.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Recent polymer-based computer-assisted design and
      computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials have been commercialized for 
      inlay restorations, a polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) and composite
      resin nanoceramics. Little independent evidence regarding their mechanical
      properties exists. Internal adaptation is an important factor for the clinical
      success and longevity of a restoration, and data concerning this parameter for
      inlays made with these blocks are scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro
      study was to evaluate and compare the mechanical properties (flexural strength,
      flexural modulus, Vickers hardness, fracture toughness) and the internal
      adaptation of these recent polymer-based blocks with a lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic block. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The materials tested in this study
      were a PICN material (Vita Enamic), 2 composite resin nanoceramics (Lava
      Ultimate; 3M ESPE and Cerasmart; GCDental Products), and a lithium disilicate
      glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD). Mechanical properties were evaluated according to 
      ISO norm DIS 6872:2013. Bar-shaped specimens (18x3x3 mm) were prepared and
      submitted to a 3-point bend test using a universal testing machine at a
      cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min. In addition, identical cavities were prepared in 
      60 human mandibular extracted molars (n=15) and optically scanned to receive
      mesioocclusodistal inlays milled with the 4 materials tested in a CEREC Inlab
      milling machine. The replica technique and a stereomicroscope (x20) were used to 
      measure the internal fit of the inlays at 9 preselected locations. All data were 
      statistically analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and the post hoc Tukey multiple
      comparison or Games-Howell test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The mean flexural strength 
      of the tested blocks ranged from 148.7 +/-9.5 MPa (Vita Enamic) to 216.5 +/-28.3 
      MPa (Cerasmart). The mean flexural modulus ranged from 23.3 +/-6.4 GPa (Vita
      Enamic) to 52.8 +/-10.5 GPa (IPS e.max CAD). The mean Vickers hardness ranged
      from 0.66 +/-0.02 GPa (Cerasmart) to 5.98 +/-0.69 GPa (IPS e.max CAD). The mean
      fracture toughness ranged from 1.2 +/-0.17 MPa.m(1/2) (Cerasmart) to 1.8 +/-0.29 
      MPa.m(1/2) (IPS e.max CAD). The values for internal discrepancy ranged from 119
      +/-55 mum to 234 +/-51 mum. The mean internal discrepancy was significantly
      higher for Lava Ultimate (P<.05) than IPS e.max CAD and Cerasmart but not for
      Vita Enamic. The factor ''material'' was statistically significant in relation to
      the mechanical properties evaluated in this study (P<.05). The Pearson
      correlation was negative between the flexural strength results and the internal
      discrepancy of the materials tested (R(2)=0.941; P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The
      mechanical properties of the CAD-CAM block materials tested were within the
      acceptable range for fabrication of single restorations according to the ISO
      standard for ceramics (ISO 6872:2008). IPS e.max CAD and Cerasmart were observed 
      to have superior flexural strength and better internal fit.

TI  - Digital evaluation of the fit of zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate crowns with
      a new three-dimensional approach.
PG  - 9-15
LID - 10.3290/j.qi.a39402 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several methods for the evaluation of fit of computer-aided
      design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM)-fabricated restorations have been 
      described. In the study, digital models were recorded with an intraoral scanning 
      device and were measured using a new three-dimensional (3D) computer technique to
      evaluate restoration internal fit. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
      internal adaptation and fit of chairside CAD/CAM-fabricated zirconia-reinforced
      lithium silicate ceramic crowns fabricated with different post-milling protocols.
      The null hypothesis was that different post-milling protocols did not influence
      the fitting accuracy of zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate restorations. METHOD
      AND MATERIALS: A master all-ceramic crown preparation was completed on a
      maxillary right first molar on a typodont. Twenty zirconia-reinforced lithium
      silicate ceramic crowns (Celtra Duo, Dentsply Sirona) were designed and milled
      using a chairside CAD/CAM system (CEREC Omnicam, Dentsply Sirona). The 20 crowns 
      were randomly divided into two groups based on post-milling protocols: no
      manipulation after milling (Group MI) and oven fired-glazing after milling (Group
      FG). A 3D computer method was used to evaluate the internal adaptation of the
      crowns. This was based on a subtractive analysis of a digital scan of the crown
      preparation and a digital scan of the thickness of the cement space over the
      crown preparation as recorded by a polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) impression material.
      The preparation scan and PVS scan were matched in 3D and a 3D difference analysis
      was performed with a software program (OraCheck, Cyfex). Three areas of internal 
      adaptation and fit were selected for analysis: margin (MA), axial wall (AX), and 
      occlusal surface (OC). Statistical analysis was performed using 80% percentile
      and one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Scheffe test (P = .05). RESULTS: The closest
      internal adaptation of the crowns was measured at the axial wall with 102.0 +/-
      11.7 microm for group MI-AX and 106.3 +/- 29.3 microm for group FG-AX. The
      largest internal adaptation of the crowns was measured for the occlusal surface
      with 258.9 +/- 39.2 microm for group MI-OC and 260.6 +/- 55.0 microm for group
      FG-OC. No statistically significant differences were found for the post-milling
      protocols (P > .05). The 3D difference pattern was visually analyzed for each
      area with a color-coded scheme. CONCLUSION: Post-milling processing did not
      affect the internal adaptation of zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate crowns
      fabricated with a chairside CAD/CAM technique. The new 3D computer technique for 
      the evaluation of fit of restorations may be highly promising and has the
      opportunity to be applied to clinical studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the fit of single crowns fabricated using conventional,
      digital, or cast digitization methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One subject with a 
      peg-shaped maxillary lateral incisor was selected in this study. Tooth
      preparation for an all-ceramic crown was performed and 10 conventional poly(vinyl
      siloxane) impressions, and 10 digital impressions using an intraoral scanner were
      made. Each working cast was scanned using a laboratory scanner and an intraoral
      scanner. Four groups were tested Group 1: conventional impressions. Group 2: cast
      laboratory scans. Group 3: cast scans using intraoral scanner. Group 4: direct
      intraoral scans. For group 1, heat-pressed glass ceramic crowns (IPS e.max Press)
      were fabricated using casts produced from the conventional impressions. For
      groups 2-4, crowns were milled using ceramic blocks (IPS e.max CAD). Ten crowns
      were fabricated for each group. Marginal and internal gaps were measured using a 
      replica technique. Replicas were sectioned mesiodistally and buccolingually and
      were observed under a stereomicroscope. Three measurements were selected for each
      cut: occlusal, axial, and marginal. Statistical analysis was performed using
      two-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests. RESULTS: For each replica, 6 measurements were
      made for the mesiodistal and the same for the buccolingual cuts, producing 12
      measurement points per crown (4 measurements for marginal, 4 for axial, 4 for
      occlusal), 120 measurements for each group (40 measurements for marginal, 40 for 
      axial, 40 for occlusal), and 480 measurements in total. Two-way ANOVA revealed
      location to be a significant factor (p = 0.001). No significant differences among
      groups (p = 0.456), and no interactions between groups and locations (p = 0.221) 
      were found. Means for the occlusal site were significantly larger than other
      sites in most group combinations, while the difference between the marginal and
      axial sites was not significant. No significant differences among groups were
      found for each measurement. The marginal gaps ranged from 125.46 +/- 25.39 mum
      for group 3 to 135.59 +/- 24.07 mum for group 4. The smallest axial mean was in
      group 1 (98.10 +/- 18.77 mum), and the largest was 127.25 +/- 19.79 mum in group 
      4. The smallest occlusal mean was in group 2 (166.53 +/- 36.51 mum), and the
      largest occlusal mean was in group 3 (203.32 +/- 80.24 mum). CONCLUSIONS: Ceramic
      crowns, which were made using all-digital approach or cast digitization by a
      laboratory or intraoral scanner had comparable fit to those produced by
      conventional approach.

TI  - Assessment of the Internal Fit of Lithium Disilicate Crowns Using Micro-CT.
PG  - 381-6
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12274 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the internal fit of lithium
      disilicate crowns fabricated using digital technology with those fabricated by
      conventional means. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five lithium disilicate crowns
      were fabricated: 15 using digital impression and computer-aided
      design/computer-aided machining technique (group 1), 15 from the same digital
      impressions, but using a conventional die and laboratory fabrication process
      (group 2), and 15 using a conventional poly (vinyl siloxane) (PVS) impression and
      laboratory fabrication process (group 3). Tooth #15 was prepared for all-ceramic 
      restoration on an ivorine typodont, which was digitized and a replica milled in
      zirconia to serve as master model. The master zirconia model was used for the
      impression procedures. Duplicate dies of the master zirconia die were made in
      polyurethane, enabling the internal fit of each crown to be evaluated using X-ray
      microcomputed tomography. The total volume of the internal space between the
      crown and die, the mean and maximum thickness of this space, and the percentage
      of the space that was at or below 120 mum thickness was calculated for each group
      and statistically tested for significant difference using one-way ANOVA, with
      post hoc Scheffe analysis. RESULTS: Group 1 crowns resulted in a smaller volume
      of internal space (12.49 +/- 1.50 mm(3)) compared to group 2 (15.40 +/- 2.59
      mm(3) ) and to those of group 3 (18.01 +/- 2.44 mm(3)). The mean thickness of the
      internal space for group 1 (0.16 +/- 0.01 mm) and for group 2 (0.17 +/- 0.03 mm) 
      was significantly lower than that of group 3 (0.21 +/- 0.03 mm). The average
      percentage of the internal space of a thickness of 120 mum and below was
      different between the three groups: 46.73 +/- 5.66% for group 1, 37.08 +/- 17.69%
      for group 2, and 22.89 +/- 9.72% for group 3. Three-dimensional renderings of the
      internal space were also created. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study
      suggested that pressed and milled IPS e. max crowns from LAVA COS digital
      impressions had a better internal fit to the prepared tooth than pressed IPS
      e.max crowns from PVS impressions in terms of total volume of internal space,
      average thickness of internal space, and percentage of internal space at or below
      120 mum.

AB  - The composite luting gap between ceramic and dental hard tissue can be termed an 
      ""Achilles heel"". Therefore, one major goal of luting ceramics focuses on
      minimizing the inter-marginal gap area. This study evaluated the marginal
      accuracy of two all-ceramic systems. The null hypothesis was that there is no
      statistical difference between the marginal accuracy of the IPS Empress and Cerec
      3D all-ceramic systems. On 16 casts, representing different clinical situations, 
      the left first mandibular molar was prepared to receive large onlays (MOD and
      replacement of the distobuccal and distal cusps). For each cavity, one laboratory
      heat-pressed (IPS Empress) and one chairside CAD/CAM restoration (Cerec 3D) were 
      manufactured. A newly developed milling unit was used for CAM processing. The
      restorations were placed in their respective cavities and die replicas were taken
      and examined under SEM for quantitative gap measurement. The gap width was
      measured at 11 defined landmarks by two different examiners. An overall gap width
      of 56 microm (+/- 31 microm) was measured for IPS Empress, compared to the
      significantly increased value of 70 pm (+/- 32 microm) for Cerec 3D. From a
      clinical viewpoint, the statistically significant difference between the two
      systems is not relevant, since both systems still exhibit a clinically acceptable
      gap width of less than 100 microm.

TI  - Evaluation of marginal and internal fit of lithium disilicate CAD-CAM crowns with
      different finish lines by using a micro-CT technique.
LID - S0022-3913(20)30751-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.11.027 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Whether the precision of fit of computer-aided design and
      computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) complete crowns is affected by the finish 
      line configuration is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to
      evaluate the marginal and internal fit of CAD-CAM ceramic crowns made from
      lithium disilicate based on 3 different finish lines (rounded shoulder, chamfer, 
      feather-edge). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty anterior lithium disilicate complete
      crowns (n=10 per finish line group) were fabricated by following a completely
      digital workflow based on digital scans made with the TRIOS scanner. The crowns
      were adhesively cemented on duplicate dies of the respective prepared Typodont
      teeth, and the marginal gap, absolute marginal discrepancy, and internal gap were
      evaluated by using microcomputed tomography (muCT). A total of 66 values were
      obtained for each specimen from sagittal and transaxial sections, and a rendering
      software program was used to calculate the volume of the cement gap for each
      specimen by means of 3D region growing. Two-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc tests with 
      Bonferroni correction, and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare the
      values between the experimental groups (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Marginal gap and
      absolute marginal discrepancy values were statistically significantly different
      between groups. In ascending order, marginal gap values were 23 +/-14 mum for
      rounded shoulder, 54 +/-28 mum for chamfer, and 96 +/-36 mum for feather-edge
      finish lines. Absolute marginal discrepancy values were 96 +/-34 mum for rounded 
      shoulder, 124 +/-37 mum for chamfer, and 157 +/-34 mum for feather-edge finish
      lines. Internal gap values were 111 +/-14 mum for feather-edge, 136 +/-22 mum for
      chamfer, and 168 +/-25 mum for rounded shoulder finish lines. The differences in 
      cement volume between groups were not statistically significant (P=.200).
      CONCLUSIONS: All 3 finish lines produced marginal gaps within the range of
      clinically accep table values. Lithium disilicate CAD crowns with a rounded
      shoulder finish line had the best marginal fit but the poorest internal fit, and 
      lithium disilicate CAD crowns with a feather-edge finish line had the best
      internal fit but the poorest marginal fit.

TI  - Micro-CT Evaluation of the Marginal and Internal Fit of Crown and Inlay
      Restorations Fabricated Via Different Digital Scanners belonging to the Same
      CAD-CAM System.
PG  - 381-389
LID - 10.11607/ijp.6822 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the marginal and internal adaptation of all-ceramic crowns
      and inlays fabricated by different scanners of the same CAD/CAM system. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: All-ceramic crown preparations were performed on typodont maxillary 
      first premolars, and mandibular first molars were prepared for ceramic Class II
      mesio-occlusal inlays. Two intraoral scanners (CEREC Bluecam and Omnicam,
      Dentsply Sirona) and one model scanner (CEREC inEos X5, Dentsply Sirona) were
      used to scan the preparations. All restorations were fabricated by milling
      single-feldspathic ceramic blocks (CEREC Blocks). The marginal and internal
      discrepancies of restorations were evaluated via micro-CT analyses. RESULTS: For 
      linear crown measurements, the marginal gaps were 63.75 mum, 88.24 mum, and 90.89
      mum for Bluecam, Omnicam, and inEos X5, respectively. For crowns at central
      groove areas, the maximum values for Bluecam, Omnicam, and inEos X5 were found to
      be 144.78 mum, 165.19 mum, and 129.49 mum, respectively. For inlays, the highest 
      range at the midpoint of the axiopulpal line angle for Bluecam, Omnicam, and
      inEos X5 were determined as 138.57 mum, 184.33 mum, and 179.71 mum, respectively.
      In volumetric measurements, inEos X5 showed lower gap for both crowns (11.47
      mm(3)) and inlays (5.65 mm(3)) compared to both intraoral scanners. These results
      are within a clinically acceptable range. CONCLUSION: When all-ceramic crowns
      were evaluated, there were generally no significant differences found between
      scanners for the regional linear measurements, but more gaps occurred in
      restorations obtained with intraoral scanners for volumetric measurements. On the
      other hand, when the inlay restorations were evaluated, significant differences
      were found between groups except for the midpoint of the axio-pulpal line angle
      and the midpoint of the mesio-gingival margin. However, marginal and internal
      gaps of both crowns and inlays presented mean values less than 150 mum in many
      surfaces, which could be considered clinically acceptable.

      vitro comparison of the silicone replica technique, direct view, and
      3-dimensional superimposition analysis.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The crystallization process of lithium disilicate crowns
      has been reported to cause dimensional change, but whether the fit of chairside
      computer-aided design and computer-aided manufactured (CAD-CAM)
      zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate crowns is affected is unclear. PURPOSE: The 
      purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate with a 3-dimensional
      superimposition analysis technique the marginal and internal adaptation of fully 
      crystallized versus partially crystallized zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate
      ceramic CAD-CAM fabricated crowns. Additionally, the silicone replica technique
      and direct viewing of marginal gap values were compared with the 3-dimensional
      superimposition analysis technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The marginal and
      internal adaptation of a fully crystallized zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate 
      (CELTRA DUO) were compared with those of a partially crystallized
      zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (VITA SUPRINITY) after crystallization.
      Sixteen crowns (n=8) were fabricated with a chairside CAD-CAM system. The crowns 
      and die and crown assembly were scanned with an optical scanner for the
      3-dimensional superimposition analysis. Four hundred sixty-eight measurements
      were made for each crown, 78 in each 2-dimensional section. Marginal discrepancy 
      was measured by using the direct viewing technique. The internal adaptation of
      the shoulder area, axial space, and occlusal space was measured by using the
      silicone replica technique. Both gap values were compared with the 3-dimensional 
      superimposition analysis results by using the independent t test. The 2-way ANOVA
      was used to detect the effect of each variable (group and site) (alpha=.05).
      RESULTS: The VITA SUPRINITY crowns showed statistically higher marginal
      discrepancy values than the CELTRA DUO crowns in both 3-dimensional
      superimposition analysis and the direct viewing method, and the lingual aspect
      recorded the highest marginal discrepancy mean value when compared with other
      aspects. The 3-dimensional superimposition analysis and the direct viewing method
      were statistically similar (P=.076). The VITA SUPRINTY crowns showed higher
      internal gap mean values than the CELTRA DUO crowns in both 3-dimensional
      superimposition analysis and silicone replica techniques. The occlusal space
      recorded the highest mean value in both groups. Assessment by 3-dimensional
      superimposition analysis and silicone replica techniques showed statistical
      difference in internal gap values (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: CELTRA DUO showed better 
      precision fit values than VITA SUPRINITY. Three-dimensional superimposition
      analysis is a reliable method of evaluating marginal and internal adaptation.

TI  - Comparison of the Accuracy of Fit of Metal, Zirconia, and Lithium Disilicate
      Crowns Made from Different Manufacturing Techniques.
PG  - 497-503
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13029 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of fit of metal, lithium disilicate, and
      zirconia crowns, which were produced using different manufacturing techniques.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients in need of a molar crown were recruited.
      Eight crowns were fabricated for each patient: 2 zirconia, 3 lithium disilicate
      (e.max), and 3 metal-ceramic crowns using conventional, conventional/digital, and
      digital techniques. Marginal, axial, and occlusal gaps were measured using a
      replica technique. Replicas were sectioned mesiodistally and buccolingually and
      were observed under a stereomicroscope. A total of 32 measurements for each crown
      replica at 3 different points (12 marginal, 12 axial, and 8 occlusal) were
      performed. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD
      tests. RESULTS: Marginal means ranged from 116.39 +/- 32.76 microm for the
      conventional metal-ceramic group to 147.56 +/- 31.56 microm for the digital e.max
      group. The smallest axial gap was recorded for the digital zirconia group (76.19 
      +/- 23.94 microm), while the largest axial gap was recorded for the conventional 
      e.max (101.80 +/- 19.81 microm) and conventional/digital metal-ceramic groups
      (101.80 +/- 35.31 microm). The conventional e.max crowns had the smallest
      occlusal mean gap (185.59 +/- 59.09 microm), while the digital e.max group had
      the largest occlusal mean gap (295.38 +/- 67.80 microm). Type of crown had no
      significant effect on marginal (p = 0.07, f = 2.71), axial (p = 0.75, f = 0.29), 
      or occlusal fit (p = 0.099, f = 2.4), while fabrication method had a significant 
      effect on axial gap only (p = 0.169, f = 1.82, p = 0.003, f = 6.21, and p =
      0.144, f = 2 for marginal, axial, and occlusal fit, respectively). Digital
      fabrication produced significantly smaller axial gaps than the conventional
      method (p = 0.02), and the conventional digital method (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The type of crown and method of manufacturing had no effect on the marginal and
      occlusal gap of single posterior crown, while the method of manufacturing had a
      significant effect on the axial gap. The digital method produced the smallest
      axial fit in comparison with the other methods, while the type of crown had no
      effect on the axial gap.

TI  - Evaluation of Marginal and Internal Fit of CAD/CAM Endocrowns with Different
      Cavity Tapers.
LID - 10.11607/ijp.6877 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of cavity tapering on the marginal and internal
      adaptation of endocrowns fabricated from two different ceramic materials.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two mandibular molar model teeth were prepared with two
      different cavity tapers (5 and 10 degrees). Forty endocrowns in four groups (n = 
      10 each) were milled using lithium disilicate and zirconiareinforced lithium
      silicate ceramics for each cavity taper. The marginal and internal adaptation
      were measured with a stereomicroscope (x30) at 18 different points. The data were
      statistically analyzed using independent t test (P < .05). RESULTS: A
      statistically significant difference was shown among the tested groups at 10
      degrees of taper (P < .001). At 5 degrees of taper, the difference was
      insignificant. The greatest internal gap was observed on the pulpal floor in all 
      tested groups. CONCLUSION: All materials had clinically acceptable internal and
      marginal gaps; however, lithium disilicate ceramic had significantly better
      adaptation at 10 degrees of taper.

      ceramic systems for three- and four-unit implant-supported partial fixed dental
      prostheses: An in vitro study.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Adaptation is an important factor in the long-term clinical
      success of implant supported ceramic restorations. Ceramic firings may affect the
      adaptation of the restoration. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare 
      the marginal and internal adaptation of 3 different restorative materials and the
      effect of veneering/pressing on the material used for 3- and 4-unit implant
      supported fixed dental prostheses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One mandibular epoxy
      cast was prepared for 3-unit restorations and one for 4-unit restorations.
      Impressions of the casts were made and 60 stone die casts (30 3-unit, 30 4-unit) 
      produced. The casts were divided into 3 subgroups: group MCR, conventional metal 
      ceramic restorations; group POM, press-on-metal restorations; group ZIR,
      computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing CAD/CAM) zirconia
      restorations. A replica technique was used to examine the marginal and internal
      gap values. A total of 2400 measurements were made by making 40 measurements of
      each restoration. The data were evaluated statistically using analysis of
      variance and the least significant difference post hoc test (alpha=.05). RESULTS:
      The lowest marginal gaps were found in group POM (81.58 mum) and the highest in
      group MCR (103.82 mum). The differences in marginal adaptation measurements were 
      found to be statistically significant. The highest values for internal adaptation
      were found at the occlusal surface in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although veneering
      metal ceramic restorations increased the misfit of the restoration, the marginal 
      discrepancy of the materials (81 to 120 mum) can be considered clinically
      acceptable.

      analysis of the CAD-CAM systematic 3Shape.
PG  - 104-15
AB  - In the last 15 years the increasing aesthetic demand, push constantly industry
      and the clinical to entirely look for new solutions for the realization of
      all-ceramic crowns, with such characteristics to be used for both anterior and
      posterior restorations. The most greater contribution, in such sense derives from
      the finished progress in the computer sector, that have allowed the application
      of the technologies CAD-CAM, also in dentistry (2-5, 11). These systematics have 
      allowed us to get ""automatically"" structures for dental prosthesis, starting from
      the scanning of the die and passing for an intermediary phase of computerized
      planning (CAD, computer aided design), through numerical control millers (CAM,
      computer aided manufacturing), enslaved to calculating the electronic that drives
      the movement of it. The aim of this work is therefore that to analyze and to
      describe the systematic computerized 3SHAPE verifying the degree of precision,
      through the analysis of the obtainable marginal closing with the zirconia
      frameworks.

      different restorative materials: SEM and mechanical evaluation.
PG  - 284-290
LID - 10.1002/jemt.23586 [doi]
AB  - Endocrowns were manufactured using different restorative materials to evaluate
      the marginal adaptation and fracture strength. Fifty endodontically treated
      mandibular first molar teeth were divided into five groups (n = 10). Endocrowns
      were obtained from lithium disilicate glass ceramic ingots by heat-press
      technique (Group e.max Press: GEP), and from feldspathic blocks (Group Cerec:
      GC), polymer infiltrated ceramic network blocks (Group Enamic: GE), lithium
      disilicate glass ceramic blocks (Group e.max CAD: GEC), and zirconia-reinforced
      glass ceramic blocks (Group Suprinity: GS) by CAD/CAM technique. After
      thermocycling, marginal adaptation was evaluated under scanning electron
      microscope at x200 magnification. The specimens' fracture strengths were tested
      in universal test machine, and fracture types were evaluated. Statistical
      analyses were performed with Kruskal-Wallis test. The highest marginal gap value 
      was found in GEP, but no significant differences were determined among the other 
      four groups (p > .05). Significant differences were observed among the groups in 
      terms of fracture strength (p = .019). The fracture strength values of GEC were
      significantly higher than GE, GC, and GS (p < .05). Values were not significantly
      different between the GEC and GEP groups (p > .05). CAD/CAM endocrowns showed
      better marginal adaptation than heat-pressed endocrowns. Clinically acceptable
      marginal gaps were seen in both endocrown types. Both CAD/CAM and heat-pressed
      lithium disilicate glass ceramic endocrowns showed higher fracture strength.

TI  - Pulpal and Periapical Status of the Vital Teeth Used as Abutment for Fixed
      Prosthesis-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 102-114
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13433 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This is a systematic review to identify the incidence of pulp necrosis
      and/or periapical changes among vital teeth which are used as an abutment for
      crown and fixed partial dentures (FPDs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers
      independently searched two electronic databases, PubMed and Scopus. The search
      was complemented from references of included studies and published reviews.
      Studies published in the English language through January 2021 that had assessed 
      and documented the clinical and radiographic failure of crown or FPD in vital
      permanent teeth due to pulpal or periapical pathology with a follow-up of at
      least 12 months were selected. Data screening, data collection and extraction of 
      data was performed. Quality of studies involved was analyzed using the
      Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies. Meta-analysis was
      done using random effects model. Publication bias was assessed using funnel
      plots. RESULTS: Electronic searches provided 10,075 records among which 20
      studies were selected for systematic review and 7 studies were selected for
      meta-analysis. With respect to quality assessment, all the studies involved were 
      considered as high quality as the score in scale ranged between 6 and 9 as per
      the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies. The
      meta-analyses showed that there was no statistically significant difference in
      the incidence of the loss of pulp vitality or pulp necrosis through clinical and 
      radiographic examination with the follow up period of 5 years: p < 0.001, 95% CI:
      0.96-1.00, I(2) = 77.84%; 10 years: p < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.88-0.95, I(2) = 93.59%; 
      15 years: p < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.92-0.96, I(2) = 94.83%; and 20 years: p < 0.001,
      95% CI: 0.94-0.96, I(2) = 95.01%. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis revealed
      clinical and radiographic success rate ranging between 92% to 98% at different
      follow up periods ranging between 5 years and 20 years. Future high-quality
      randomized clinical controlled trials with a larger population are required to
      confirm the evidence as only observational studies were considered in this paper.

AB  - The aim of this study is to quantify the effect of the crystallization process on
      lithium disilicate ceramic crowns fabricated using a computer-aided
      design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system and to determine whether the
      effect of crystallization is clinically acceptable by comparing values of fit
      before and after the crystallization process. The mandibular right first molar
      was selected as the abutment for the experiments. Fifteen working models were
      prepared. Lithium disilicate crowns appropriate for each abutment were prepared
      using a commercial CAD/CAM system. Gaps in the marginal area and 4 internal areas
      of each crown were measured twice-before and after crystallization-using the
      silicone replica technique. The mean values of fit before and after
      crystallization were analyzed using a paired t-test to examine whether the
      conversion that occurred during crystallization affected marginal and internal
      gaps (alpha = 0.05). Gaps increased in the marginal area and decreased in the
      internal areas after crystallization. There were statistically significant
      differences in all of the investigated areas (P < 0.05). None of the values for
      marginal and internal fit of lithium disilicate CAD/CAM crowns after
      crystallization exceeded 120 mum, which is the clinically acceptable threshold.

AB  - Scanning electron microscopy was used to compare the marginal gaps of
      restorations milled by machinable ceramic systems to the marginal gaps of
      conventional laboratory-sintered ceramic restorations. For occlusal surfaces, the
      average marginal gap was 80 microns for both laboratory- and Celay-produced
      inlays. The mean gap was 200 microns and 170 microns, respectively, for Cerec T
      (turbine motor) and Cerec EM (electric motor) inlays. For approximal boxes, the
      average marginal gap was 100 microns for inlays produced with conventional
      laboratory-sintering techniques, 80 microns for Celay restorations, and 280
      microns for the Cerec T restorations, and 260 microns for Cerec EM-machined
      inlays. The ceramics used, as well as the different systems themselves, can
      influence the results and the clinical outcome of the restorations.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The accuracy of recently introduced chairside
      computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) blocks is not
      well established, and marginal integrity and internal adaptation are not known.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the marginal and
      internal adaptation of hybrid and nanoceramics using microcomputed tomography
      (mu-CT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The marginal and internal adaptation of 3
      polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network (PICN) materials (Vita Enamic [VE]; Lava
      Ultimate [LU]; Vita Suprinity [VS]) were compared with lithium disilicate (IPS
      e.max.CAD, IPS). Ninety-six specimens (48 dies and 48 crowns) were prepared (n=12
      each group) using a chairside CAD-CAM system. The restorations were scanned with 
      mu-CT, with 160 measurements made for each crown, and used in 2-dimensional (2D) 
      analysis. The marginal adaptation of marginal discrepancy (MD), absolute marginal
      discrepancy (AMD), internal adaptation of shoulder area (SA), axial space (AS),
      and occlusal space (OS) were compared using appropriate statistical analysis
      methods (alpha=.05). Cement volumes were compared using 3D analysis. RESULTS: The
      IPS blocks showed higher MD (130 mum), AMD (156 mum), SA (111 mum) (P<.05), AS
      (52 mum), and OS (192 mum) than the other blocks (P<.01). The adaptation values
      of VS were significantly lower than those of the IPS block (P<.05). The adaption 
      values of the LU and VE blocks were significantly lower than those of others
      (P<.01) but were statistically similar to one another (P>.05). IPS had the
      largest cement space at 18 mm(3) (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: The marginal and internal 
      adaptation values were within a clinically acceptable range for all 3 hybrids and
      nanoceramics tested.

TI  - Marginal adaptation of full-coverage CAD/CAM restorations: in vitro study using a
      non-destructive method.
PG  - 61-72
AB  - AIM: Marginal fit of full-coverage crowns is a major requirement for long term
      success of this kind of restorations. The purpose of the study was to verify the 
      marginal adaptation of computer assisted design (CAD)/computer assisted
      manufacturing (CAM) crowns on prepared teeth and on plaster dies. METHODS: Four
      couples of materials: zirconia-ceramic veneering (DC-Zircon, DCS Dental,
      Allschwill, CH/Cercon S, Degussa, DeguDent GmbH, Hanau, Germany),
      fiber-reinforced composite-composite veneering (DC-Tell, DCS Dental/Gradia, GC
      Europe, LEuven, Belgium), titanium-ceramic veneering (DC Titan, DCS
      Dental/Tikrom, Orotig, Verona, Italy) and titanium-composite veneering (DC Titan,
      DCS Dental/Gradia, GC Europe) were evaluated following the guidelines provided by
      ADA specific #8. Five crowns were fabricated for each material. Marginal gap
      values were measured at four points (0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees and 270
      degrees starting from the centre of the vestibular surface) around the finishing 
      line, on prepared teeth and on plaster dies at each step of the fabrication
      process. Digital photographs were taken at each reference point and a computer
      software was used to measure the amount of marginal discrepancy in microm.
      Statistical analysis was performed using t test at 95 percent confidence
      interval. RESULTS: All the tested materials, except for fiber-reinforced
      composite, show a marginal adaptation within the limits of ADA specification
      (25-40 microm). The application of veneering material causes decay in marginal
      adaptation, except for fiber-reinforced composite. CONCLUSION: Within the
      limitations of this study, it was concluded that marginal fit of CAD/CAM
      restoration is within the limits considered clinically acceptable by ADA
      specification #8. From the results of this in vitro study, it can be stated that 
      CAD/CAM crowns produced with DCS system show a marginal adaptation within the
      limits of ADA specific #8, therefore milled CAD/CAM crowns can be considered a
      good alternative to more traditional waxing-investing-casting technique.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Although different preparation designs have been proposed
      for onlays fabricated by computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD-CAM), their effect on marginal adaptation is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose
      of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of tooth preparation designs
      on the marginal and internal adaptation of ceramic-reinforced composite resin
      CAD-CAM onlays. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A traditional preparation with a heavy
      chamfer on the functional cusp and a contrabevel on the nonfunctional cusp and a 
      shoulder preparation with equal reduction on all cusps were used for
      mesial-occlusal-distal (MOD) onlay preparations. Ceramic-reinforced composite
      resin onlays were designed and milled based on the scanned prepared teeth. A
      digital silicone replica technique was used to determine marginal discrepancies
      between preparations and onlay restorations. A total of 100 numeric distances
      (representations of the fit in each region) were measured in 3 distinct regions: 
      the buccal margin, lingual margin, and internal area. Independent Student t tests
      were used to determine significant differences (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Traditional 
      preparation designs resulted in significantly smaller overall discrepancies (50.9
      +/-0.5 mum and 139.1 +/-5.4 mum, P<.001) and smaller marginal discrepancies in
      the buccal (49.7 +/-1.4 mum and 135.8 +/-2.2 mum, P<.001) and lingual areas (47.1
      +/-1.0 mum and 133.4 +/-1.1 mum, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The marginal adaptation of
      ceramic-reinforced composite resin CAD-CAM onlays was affected by the preparation
      design. The traditional preparation design offered better marginal adaptation;
      therefore, it is recommended in clinical practice.

TI  - Effect of Chairside CAD/CAM Restoration Type on Marginal Fit Accuracy: A
      Comparison of Crown, Inlay and Onlay Restorations.
PG  - 119-127
LID - 10.1922/EJPRD_2121Abduo09 [doi]
AB  - Chairside CAD/CAM is a convenient approach for fabricating dental restorations.
      However, the effect of CAD/CAM restoration type on marginal fit accuracy has not 
      been fully investigated. This study evaluated of the marginal fit accuracy of 3
      chairside CAD/ CAM restoration types (crown, inlay and onlay) using CEREC Bluecam
      (BC) and CEREC Omnicam (OC) scanners. Three artificial maxillary first molars
      received crown, inlay and onlay preparations. A total of 10 CAD/CAM ceramic
      restorations were produced for each tooth by each intraoral scanner. The marginal
      gap was measured along the preparation margin. For the BC, all the restorations
      had similar marginal gaps (crowns = 113.9 mum; inlays = 120.9 mum; onlays = 132.5
      mum) (p = 0.20), while for the OC, the crowns (72.2 mum) and the inlays (74.9
      mum) exhibited better marginal fit than the onlays (96.4 mum) (p = 0.003). For
      every restoration type, the OC provided a superior outcome compared with the BC. 
      Therefore, the restoration type influenced the marginal gap, where the crowns
      tended to have the least marginal gap while the onlays had the greatest marginal 
      gap. The newer scanner (OC) of the same manufacturer was more accurate than the
      older scanner (BC).

TI  - Relationship between internal accuracy and load-bearing capacity of minimally
      invasive lithium disilicate occlusal veneers.
PG  - 365-372
LID - 10.11607/ijp.6735 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To test whether internal accuracy affects the load-bearing capacity of
      0.5-mm-thick occlusal veneers made out of milled or heat-pressed lithium
      disilicate (LS2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracted human molars (N = 80) were
      divided into four groups (n = 20 each) depending on the bonding substrate (enamel
      [E] or dentin [D]) and the fabrication method (milling [CAD] or heat pressing
      [PRE]) for the occlusal LS2 veneers: (1) E-CAD, (2) D-CAD, (3) E-PRE, or (4)
      D-PRE. After restoration fabrication, the abutment teeth and the corresponding
      restorations were scanned and superimposed in order to measure the marginal and
      internal accuracy. After adhesive cementation, the specimens were
      thermomechanically aged and thereafter loaded until fracture. The load-bearing
      capacities (Fmax) were measured. Fmax and the marginal and internal accuracy
      between the groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test (P < .05) and pairwise
      group comparisons. In addition, the relationship between Fmax and the internal
      accuracy was analyzed using Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: Median Fmax
      values (and first and third quartiles) per group were as follows: 1,495 N (Q1:
      932; Q3: 2'318) for E-CAD; 1,575 N (Q1: 1,314; Q3: 1,668) for E-PRE; 1,856 N (Q1:
      1,555; Q3: 2,013) for D-CAD; and 1,877 N (Q1: 1,566; Q3: 2,131) for D-PRE. No
      statistical difference was found between the groups (P = .0981). Overall, the
      internal accuracy in the areas of the cusp (P < .0007) and fossa (P < .0001)
      showed significant differences. While no significant differences were detected in
      the marginal area (P = .3518), a significant correlation with a negative linear
      relationship was found between the 3D internal accuracy and the Fmax values (P = 
      .0007). CONCLUSION: An increase in the internal accuracy raised the load-bearing 
      capacity of minimally invasive LS2 occlusal veneers. In general, the restorations
      bonded to dentin in the occlusal regions showed a better accuracy compared to
      those bonded to enamel.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The development of computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing technology has enabled the fabrication of implant-retained
      restorations. However, information on the marginal and axial accuracy of
      restorations fabricated by different digitizing techniques with different
      antirotational abutment features is not sufficient. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 
      in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of digitizing techniques on the fit 
      of implant-retained crowns with 2 antirotational features. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      An experimental working cast housing a tissue-level dental implant was created.
      Resin-retained abutments with different antirotational features were connected to
      the implant. Optical impressions of 2 abutment types were obtained separately
      with 1 chairside and 2 laboratory approaches. Alumina silicate restorations were 
      milled from chairside optical impressions, and ceramic oxide cores were milled
      from laboratory optical impressions. Restoration fit was evaluated from axial
      sections of restorations with silicone materials representing the marginal and
      axial gaps. Axial and marginal fits were measured on digital photographs of the
      sectioned specimens with a computer program. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare
      differences between abutments with 2 different antirotational features and
      digitizing techniques separately for the marginal and axial fits of single
      implant-retained crowns. A post hoc least significant difference test was used to
      compare digitizing techniques (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Significant differences in
      the marginal fit of single-implant-retained crowns were found among digitizing
      techniques (P=.011) and between antirotational features (P<.001). No significant 
      difference in the axial fit of single-implant-retained crowns was found among
      digitizing techniques (P=.905) or between antirotational features (P=.075).
      CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this in vitro study, the marginal fit of
      single-implant-retained crowns was affected by antirotational abutment features. 
      Furthermore, digitizing techniques were found to play an important role in the
      marginal fit of single-implant-retained restorations.

AB  - The ideal restoration of endodontically treated teeth (ETT) has been widely and
      controversially discussed in the literature. Prevention of healthy dental
      structure is essential to help mechanical stabilization of tooth-restoration
      integrity, increase the amount of suitable surfaces for adhesion and thus
      positively affect the long-term success. ETT are affected by a higher risk of
      biomechanical failure than vital teeth. With the development of adhesive systems,
      the need for post-core restorations is also reduced. Especially for restoration
      of excessively damaged ETT, endocrowns have been used as an alternative to the
      conventional post-core and fixed partial dentures. Compared to conventional
      methods, good aesthetics, better mechanical performance, and less cost and clinic
      time are the advantages of endocrowns.

TI  - The Effect of Milling Metal Versus Milling Wax on Implant Framework Retention and
      Adaptation.
PG  - e739-e743
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12914 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The metal framework of implant-supported restorations can be made using 
      different methods. For a successful outcome, the acceptability of each method
      depends on the retention and fit of the restoration. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate and compare the retention and adaptation of copings fabricated using two
      methods: casting wax patterns made by computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology, and milling sintered chromium-cobalt (Cr-Co) 
      blocks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four abutment analogs (height, 5.5 mm) were
      divided into two groups according to the framework fabrication method. In one
      group, wax patterns were prepared using a CAM milling machine, and they were cast
      with a Ni-Cr-Ti metal alloy. In the second group, the copings were milled from
      Cr-Co blocks using a CAD/CAM milling machine. All copings were equal in contour, 
      thickness, and internal relief and were seated on the abutment analogs after the 
      necessary adjustments. The vertical marginal discrepancy was investigated using a
      silicone replica method and stereomicroscope with 75x magnification. After
      copings were cemented onto the abutment analogs using zinc phosphate, a tensile
      resistance test was performed using a universal testing machine. Mann-Whitney U
      and Student's t-test were used for statistical analyses at a significance level
      of 0.05. RESULTS: An independent sample t-test revealed a significant difference 
      between the two groups for retention (p = 0.010), and the milled wax group showed
      higher tensile resistance compared with the milled metal group. There was also a 
      significant difference between the two groups in marginal discrepancy (p <
      0.001), with a larger marginal gap in the milled metal group compared with the
      milled wax group. The milled metal copings required more adjustments to fit on
      the abutment analogs compared with the wax milled copings (p < 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: The CAD/CAM technique for wax milling resulted in more retentive
      copings with better marginal and internal adaptations compared with milling the
      metal blocks.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different production methods 
      of resin and ceramic inlays on marginal and internal adaptation, adjustment time,
      and proximal contacts. Forty premolars were selected, embedded (their roots), and
      prepared to receive inlays that were made as follows (n=10): LaRe-digital
      impression with a Lava C.O.S. scanner, followed by milling of Lava Ultimate block
      (composite resin) in a milling center; CeRe-digital impression with a Cerec 3D
      Bluecam scanner, followed by milling of Lava Ultimate block in Cerec;
      CeDis-digital impression with a Cerec 3D Bluecam scanner, followed by milling of 
      IPS e.max CAD block (lithium disilicate) in Cerec; and PresDis-impression with
      polyvinyl siloxane, inlay made using the lost wax technique and IPS e.max Press
      pressed ceramic (lithium disilicate). Marginal and internal adaptations were
      measured using the replica technique. The inlay adjustments were performed using 
      diamond burs in a contra-angle hand piece, and the time for adjustment was
      recorded using a timer, in seconds. The tightness of the proximal contact was
      measured using standardized metal blades. The statistical analyses for marginal
      fit data showed that at the cervical edge, CeDis (177.8 mum) had greater misfit
      than CeRe (116.7 mum), while all the groups had similar adaptation at the
      occlusal edge. The groups had similar internal fit at the pulpal wall, while LaRe
      (104.7 mum) > CeDis (66.7 mum) = CeRe (76.7 mum) at the axial wall. The groups
      restored with lithium disilicate ceramic took more time for adjustment when
      compared to the resin restorative material. The lowest proximal contact, in
      micrometers, was seen in the CeRe group (8.8 mum).

      males and 58 (41.7%) were females with a male to female ratio of 1.4:1.
      De-cementation was the most common complication (41.7%). Least common
      complication was secondary caries (6.5%). Level-1 complications were more
      prevalent (77.7%) than level-2 complications (22.3%). In 91.4% cases,
      complications occurred before the FDP completed their fifth-years' service life
      with 25.2% of these occurring within the first years' service life. CONCLUSION:
      Irrespective of the type of complications, level-1 complications were more common
      with de-cementation being the most common complication. One-quarter of all the
      complications occurred within the first-year service life of the FDPs
      highlighting concern over the quality of the provided MC-FDPs. .

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of CAD/CAM technology in the
      surgical treatment of trigonocephaly compared to conventional surgical treatment.
      Children operated from trigonocephaly between 2017 and 2019 at the French
      Referral Center for craniosynostosis of Femme-Mere-Enfant Hospital of Lyon,
      France, were included and separated in two groups. Group 1 included children
      operated on trigonocephaly using CAD-CAM technology; Group 2 included children
      operated on trigonocephaly without CAD-CAM technology. Age, gender, duration of
      surgery, complications, blood transfusion and esthetic results were analyzed. The
      experience of the craniofacial surgeon was also evaluated and quantified in order
      to weigh the results. Twenty children were included in the study: 10 in the Group
      1 and 10 in the Group 2. No statistical difference was observed between these 2
      groups concerning the duration of the surgery (137 min +/- 39,17 versus 137,2 min
      +/- 64,50; p = 0,85), complications (20% in group 1 versus 10% in group 2; p =
      1), the realization of blood transfusion (80% in group 1 versus 70% in group 2)
      and the esthetic results (5/5 in group 1 versus 4,6/5 in group 2; p = 0,21).
      However, the use of CAD-CAM technology significantly accelerates the duration of 
      surgery by 25.8 min on average for the surgeon starting in craniofacial surgery
      (from 197,8 +/- 10,21 min without CAD-CAM to 172 +/- 18,76 min with CAD-CAM; p = 
      0.05) but significantly slows the experienced surgeon by 25.4 min on average
      (from 76,6 +/- 8,65 min without CAD-CAM to 102 +/- 6,2 min with CAD-CAM; p =
      0.01). In the management of trigonocephaly, CAD/CAM technology seems to present a
      modest interest for the experienced surgeon but presents a real interest for the 
      young surgeon. Within the limitations of the study, it seems that CAD/CAM
      technology is a relevant addition to the armamentarium of doctors who are in
      training because surgical time is reduced.

TI  - A Survey of Dentists' Perception of Chair-Side CAD/CAM Technology.
LID - 68 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare9010068 [doi]
AB  - The application of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing
      (CAD/CAM) technology in dentistry has rapidly expanded. This survey aimed to
      investigate attitudes and current practice of dentists in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
      regarding chair-side CAD/CAM technology. An online questionnaire was prepared and
      sent to a convenience sample of dentists in Riyadh. Questions related to practice
      aspects of chair-side CAD/CAM system, attitudes and training were presented. A
      total of 114 questionnaires were completed (77.6% response rate). Study
      population comprised dentists of a wide range of clinical experience who are
      working in the various regions of Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. Of the participants,
      27.2% indicated the presence of a chair-side CAD/CAM system at their current
      workplace and 57% used the chair-side CAD/CAM in the fabrication of dental
      crowns. The vast majority of participants (81%) believe that the overall quality 
      of chair-side CAD/CAM restorations is at least as good as those fabricated by a
      lab technician or much better. Most responding dentists considered the chair-side
      CAD/CAM system as important in terms of time saving, boosting the number of
      visiting patients and income improvement. The willingness to dedicate the time
      and effort to learn the chair-side CAD/CAM technology was apparent amid a high
      proportion of dentists (75.4%). The findings of this pilot survey reflect broad
      satisfaction and positive attitude among the surveyed dentists towards use and
      outcome of chair-side CAD/CAM technology in the dental clinical practice. It
      seems that the CAD/CAM technology has infiltrated into the workflow of Saudi
      dental practices with speculations of growing implementation among the wider
      sector of dental practitioners in the future.

TI  - Strength of zirconia fixed partial dentures: review of the literature.
PG  - 15-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is a systematic review of the literature on the 
      strength and long-term behavior of zirconia FPDs. METHODS: The literature search 
      was performed using as the primary source the Medline database. Were also imposed
      a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to narrow the search to
      differentiate the two distinct parts in which it was structured the review. In
      addition, MeSH terms were applied to further refine the choice of articles more
      relevant to the review. In the part of the review concerning the long-term
      behavior of zirconia fixed partial dentures were considered useful only those
      studies with a minimum follow-up of one year. RESULTS: The search provided a
      total of 813 articles, but only 25 were considered for the review because they
      were the only ones who satisfied search criteria. In particular, 13 items relate 
      to the mechanical strength of zirconia prostheses and 12 regarding the long term 
      behavior of zirconia FPDs. The resistance values also exceed the 2000 N while the
      survival rate reaches to almost 94%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this review, Zirconia 
      FPDs can be considered reliable products in both the anterior and posterior
      fields with survival rates comparable to traditional metal-ceramic prostheses.

TI  - Accuracy of marginal fit of an implant-supported framework fabricated by 3D
      printing versus subtractive manufacturing technique: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
LID - S0022-3913(21)00274-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.05.010 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Evidence comparing additive 3-dimensional printing (3DP)
      with subtractive milling for implant-supported frameworks is lacking. PURPOSE:
      The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the
      marginal fit and accuracy of complete-arch implant-supported frameworks (CA),
      implant-retained fixed partial dentures (IRFPDs), single implant crowns (SICs),
      and interim implant-retained restorations (IIRRs) by using additive manufacturing
      (AM) and subtractive manufacturing (SM) methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An
      electronic search was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and the
      Cochrane Library for articles published up to August 2020. The authors acquired
      the data and evaluated the articles, and the final selection of articles was made
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Methodological Index for
      Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) scale was used to evaluate the quality of the
      included studies. Heterogeneity was evaluated, and meta-analyses with subgroup
      analyses were performed in the selected studies. RESULTS: The database search
      resulted in 960 articles. After removing duplicate articles (410 studies), the
      titles and abstracts were screened in detail, and 10 in vitro studies were
      selected for qualitative analysis and 9 for quantitative analysis according to
      the eligibility criteria. Subgroup analyses were performed to compare the 3DP
      versus the SM technique for different types of implant-supported frameworks
      (IRFPDs, SICs, IIRRs, and CA). In the IRFPDs analysis, the marginal fit accuracy 
      of the 3DP systems was higher than that with the subtractive manufacturing method
      (P<.001). In the subgroup analysis of SIC frameworks (P=.55) and CA (P=.67)
      frameworks, no significant difference was observed in the assessed techniques.
      CONCLUSIONS: The marginal fit of implant-supported frameworks manufactured by AM 
      or SM methods is in the clinically acceptable range.

TI  - Parameters Affecting the Retention Force of CAD/CAM Telescopic Crowns: A Focused 
      Review of In Vitro Studies.
LID - 4429 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm10194429 [doi]
AB  - Telescopic systems constructed using computer aided design and computer aided
      manufacture (CAD/CAM) can overcome many drawbacks associated with conventionally 
      constructed ones. Since retention is considered the most important function of
      these retainers, this scoping review aimed to discuss and summarize the
      parameters that affect this function in CAD/CAM-manufactured telescopic crowns
      and to compare their retention force values with the recommended retention force.
      An electronic search was done in Pubmed and Google Scholar databases using
      different keyword combinations to find the related articles. Seventeen articles
      that follow the eligibility criteria for this review were selected and analyzed
      for detection of each of the tested parameters and their effect on retention
      force. The parameters tested in these articles were divided into parameters
      related to design, manufacturing, material type, and test condition. Regardless
      of the effect of these parameters, the retention force values recorded in most of
      the selected studies laid within or were higher than the recommended retention
      force (2.5-10 N), which indicated the need to design and set the combination of
      materials of telescopic systems according to oral biomechanics.

TI  - Prevalence of proximal contact loss between implant-supported prostheses and
      adjacent natural teeth: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.05.025 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Proximal contact loss between implant-supported prostheses 
      and adjacent natural teeth is a complication that has been reported in clinical
      practice. However, the prevalence of the condition is unclear. PURPOSE: The
      purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the proportion 
      of reported proximal contact loss between implant-supported prostheses and
      adjacent natural teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This systematic review followed the
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
      methodology criteria and was registered on the international prospective register
      of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) platform (CRD42021225138). The electronic search
      was conducted by using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases
      to September 2020. The formulated population, intervention, comparison, outcome
      (PICO) question was ""Is there a correlation of the proximal contact loss between 
      implant-supported prostheses and the adjacent natural tooth?"" A single-arm
      meta-analysis of proportion was performed to evaluate the cumulative prevalence
      of survival and complication rates. RESULTS: This review included 10 studies,
      half of which presented proximal contact loss rates higher than 50%. In the
      general analysis, the open proximal contact showed a cumulative proportion of 41%
      (confidence interval: 30% to 53%; heterogeneity: I(2)=98%; t(2)=0.578; P<.01).
      From the subanalysis, the mesial contact (47%; confidence interval: 32% to 62%;
      heterogeneity: I(2)= 96%; t(2)=0.657; P<.01) and the mandibular arch (41%;
      confidence interval: 30% to 52%; heterogeneity: I(2)=92%; t(2)=0.302; P<.01) were
      found to have higher prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of proximal contact 
      loss was high, occurring more frequently with the mesial contact and in the
      mandibular arch. Significant differences were not found in relation to sex or
      between the posterior and anterior regions.

TI  - Influence of the chemical composition of monolithic zirconia on its optical and
      mechanical properties. Systematic review and meta-regression.
LID - 10.2186/jpr.JPR_D_20_00218 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This systematic review set out to investigate the influence of chemical 
      composition and specimen thickness of monolithic zirconia on its optical and
      mechanical properties. Meta-analysis and meta-regression analyzed the effects of 
      variations in percentages of yttrium, aluminum, and specimen thickness of
      monolithic zirconia. STUDY SELECTION: The review followed recommendations put
      forward in the PRISMA checklist. An electronic search for relevant articles
      published up to October 2019 was conducted in the Pubmed, Cochrane, Scopus,
      Scielo, and Web of Science databases, with no language limits and articles
      published in the last 10 years. From 167 relevant articles; applying inclusion
      criteria based on the review's PICO question, 26 articles were selected for
      qualitative synthesis (systematic review) and 24 for quantitative synthesis
      (meta-analysis). Experimental in vitro studies published were selected and their 
      quality was assessed using the modified Consort scale for in vitro studies of
      dental materials. RESULTS: The variables yttrium, aluminum and thickness were
      analyzed in random effects models, observing high heterogeneity ( > 75%), and
      finding statistically significant influences on the properties of monolithic
      zirconia (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the review's limitations, it may be
      concluded that variations in the percentage of yttrium and aluminum influence the
      optical and mechanical properties of monolithic zirconia, making it more or less 
      esthetic and resistant in relation to each variable. The clinical implications of
      these findings can help select the most appropriate type of zirconia to meet the 
      different clinical needs when restoring different regions (posterior or
      anterior).

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether patients benefit from a secondary 
      reconstruction since it carries the risks of no improvement or worsening of their
      current situation. Patients treated with individual
      computer-aided-design/computer-aided-manufacturing (CAD/CAM) ceramic implants
      were reviewed. To ascertain changes throughout the secondary reconstruction, the 
      study investigators reviewed ophthalmological examinations, took volumetric
      measurements of the orbits and asked the patients for evaluation of their
      situation before and after the reconstruction. Points addressed were double
      vision, visual acuity, field of vision, limitations in daily life and aesthetic
      considerations. A total of 14 patients were reviewed and 11 answered the
      questionnaire. Ophthalmological examinations showed that the physical integrity
      of the eye was maintained. Volumetric measurements preopeatively (33.94 +/- 3.24 
      cm(3)) and postoperatively (30.67 +/- 2.07 cm(3)) showed that a statistically
      significant overcorrection of orbital volume leads to good functional and
      aesthetic outcomes. Patients' subjective opinions were that they greatly
      benefitted, especially concerning limitations in daily life, which improved by
      4.4 +/- 2.8 points out of 10 possible points, and aesthetics, with an improvement
      of 5.9 +/- 1.78 points. Based on these findings, we conclude that secondary
      reconstructions contribute to improvement of the patients' quality of life and
      therefore should be considered as an option to improve patients' condition.

TI  - Esthetic mock-ups: a clinical study of reproducibility.
PG  - 310-323
AB  - The mock-up technique is a widely used clinical method to achieve successful
      esthetic and functional treatments. Several methods have been described to
      fabricate the mock-up, either directly in the mouth or indirectly using a
      silicone index or CAD/CAM options. The mock-up mainly serves as a guide during
      the preparation stage, but it is also a useful communication and validation tool.
      Based on the controlled depth preparation concept, the mock-up ensures a specific
      restoration thickness sufficient for the ceramic and respectful of the enamel
      tissue. Any error in fabricating the mock-up may cause debonding complications
      and have a negative impact on the esthetic result. Currently, most mock-ups are
      created indirectly using a silicone index injected with a temporary resin that
      mimics the final esthetic project. The present article reports on the protocol
      involved in a clinical study conducted to validate the precision of
      reproducibility of this indirect method. Two different options for creating the
      silicone index were investigated. Twenty mock-ups were realized on the same
      subject by the same operator. Each mock-up was 3D scanned to compare its
      reproducibility using the superimposition of 3D meshes. The results show that the
      reproducibility of indirect mock-ups is clinically acceptable (~ 100 microm),
      regardless of the fabrication method used. However, a combination of standard
      silicone and a rigid tray produces better results than hard silicone alone.

TI  - Type IV hypersensitivity associated with restorative materials: Clinical report
      and systematic literature review.
LID - S0022-3913(21)00108-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.01.034 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Type IV hypersensitivity reactions (Type IV HR) are immune 
      responses mediated by antigen-specific effector T cells. PURPOSE: The purpose of 
      this clinical report and systematic review was to report the clinicopathological 
      features of Type IV HR in the oral mucosa and to present a systematic literature 
      review of case reports and case series of individuals with Type IV HR in the oral
      mucosa related to contact with dental materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The
      presented clinical lesions were melanotic macules with burning that affected the 
      internal labial mucosa in contact with composite resin veneer crowns.
      Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of the lesion was performed.
      The systematic literature review was performed based on a search in 4 electronic 
      databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Ovid). RESULTS:
      Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD4, CD8, CD20, CD3, tryptase, and
      CD117. After conservative treatment, the patient reported improvement of
      symptoms, and a decrease in the number of inflammatory cells was verified.
      Twenty-one articles were included in the review. Unlike the present patient, the 
      authors of all the articles recommended radical treatment with the removal of the
      dental material. CONCLUSIONS: Type IV HR in oral mucosa is rare, and the
      assessment of clinical and histopathological characteristics is essential to
      perform an accurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.
